Feature: Application Load Time
The application should load within 3 seconds for both web and mobile versions. Performance tests should confirm the load time across different devices and browsers. Any deviations from the 3-second load time must trigger a performance optimization process. The load time should remain consistent even under varying network conditions. User experience should not be compromised due to load time delays.

Scenario: Verify application load time on web version
Given the application is deployed on the web platform
When a user accesses the application using a web browser
Then the application should load within 3 seconds
@50
Scenario: Verify application load time on mobile version
Given the application is deployed on the mobile platform
When a user accesses the application using a mobile device
Then the application should load within 3 seconds

Scenario Outline: Verify application load time across different devices and browsers
Given the application is deployed on both web and mobile platforms
When a user accesses the application using <device> on <browser>
Then the application should load within 3 seconds
Examples:
| device    | browser        |
| Desktop   | Chrome         |
| Desktop   | Firefox        |
| Mobile    | Safari         |
| Tablet    | Edge           |

Scenario: Trigger performance optimization process on load time deviation
Given the application load time is being monitored
When the load time exceeds 3 seconds
Then a performance optimization process should be triggered
@50
Scenario: Verify consistent load time under varying network conditions
Given the application is accessed under different network conditions
When a user accesses the application
Then the load time should remain consistent within 3 seconds

Scenario: Ensure user experience is not compromised due to load time delays
Given the application load time is being monitored
When the load time exceeds 3 seconds
Then user experience should not be compromised
