Feature: Cloud Infrastructure and Auto-Scaling
@55
Scenario: Automatic resource adjustment based on traffic spikes
Given the application is running on cloud infrastructure
When there is a traffic spike
Then the application should automatically adjust resources to accommodate the increased load
@55
Scenario: Support for horizontal scaling
Given the application is deployed on cloud infrastructure
When there is a need to scale horizontally
Then the cloud infrastructure should support horizontal scaling without issues
@55
Scenario: Continuous monitoring of performance metrics
Given the application is running on cloud infrastructure
When the application is operational
Then performance metrics must be monitored continuously
@55
Scenario: Handling of up to 10,000 concurrent users
Given the application is running on cloud infrastructure
When up to 10,000 users access the application concurrently
Then the system should handle the load without degradation
@55
Scenario: Seamless and transparent auto-scaling
Given the application is running on cloud infrastructure
When auto-scaling is triggered
Then the process should be seamless and transparent to users
@55
Scenario: Minimal downtime during scaling events
Given the application is running on cloud infrastructure
When scaling events occur
Then downtime should be minimal
@55
Scenario: Alerts for scaling failures
Given the application is running on cloud infrastructure
When a scaling failure occurs
Then alerts must be generated to notify the issue
@55
Scenario: Cost-efficient resource allocation
Given the application is running on cloud infrastructure
When resources are allocated
Then the allocation should optimize cost efficiency
@55
Scenario: Regular scaling tests
Given the application is running on cloud infrastructure
When scaling tests are scheduled
Then scaling tests must be conducted regularly
@55
Scenario: Robust integration with cloud service provider APIs
Given the application is running on cloud infrastructure
When integrating with cloud service provider APIs
Then the integration must be robust
