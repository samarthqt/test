Feature: High Availability and Minimal Downtime
@56
Scenario: System maintains 99.9% uptime
Given the system is running
When uptime is monitored over a period
Then the system should maintain 99.9% uptime
@56
Scenario: Redundancy in critical components
Given the system has critical components
When redundancy is implemented
Then all critical components should have redundancy built-in
@56
Scenario: Testing and validation of failover mechanisms
Given the system has failover mechanisms
When failover mechanisms are tested
Then failover mechanisms should be validated to ensure functionality
@56
Scenario: Scheduled maintenance duration
Given scheduled maintenance is planned
When maintenance is performed
Then scheduled maintenance should not exceed 1 hour per month
@56
Scenario: Notifications for downtime events
Given a downtime event occurs
When the system detects downtime
Then notifications must be sent for the downtime event
@56
Scenario: Consistency in data replication across nodes
Given data replication is enabled
When data is replicated across nodes
Then data replication must ensure consistency across all nodes
@56
Scenario: Load balancing traffic distribution
Given the system handles traffic
When traffic is distributed
Then load balancing should distribute traffic evenly
@56
Scenario: Disaster recovery plan documentation and testing
Given a disaster recovery plan exists
When the plan is tested
Then the disaster recovery plan must be documented and tested
@56
Scenario: Real-time monitoring of system health
Given the system is operational
When system health is monitored
Then real-time monitoring of system health is required
@56
Scenario: User sessions persistence through failover events
Given user sessions are active
When a failover event occurs
Then user sessions should persist through failover events
