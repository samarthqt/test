Feature: Concurrent User Handling
The system should be able to handle at least 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation. The system must maintain optimal performance with 10,000 concurrent users.

Scenario: Load testing to verify system's ability to handle 10,000 concurrent users
Given the system is set up for load testing
When 10,000 concurrent users access the system
Then the system should maintain optimal performance without degradation
@51
Scenario: Application response times during peak usage
Given the system is under peak usage conditions
When users perform operations simultaneously
Then the application should provide consistent response times
@51
Scenario: System logs capture performance issues
Given the system is handling 10,000 concurrent users
When any performance issue occurs
Then system logs must capture the issue for analysis and resolution
@51
Scenario: Scalability tests for accommodating more users
Given the system is handling 10,000 concurrent users
When scalability tests are performed
Then the system should be able to scale to accommodate more users if necessary
