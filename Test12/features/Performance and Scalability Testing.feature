Feature: Performance and Scalability Testing
@17
Scenario: Application loads within 3 seconds for all users
Given the application is deployed on cloud infrastructure
When a user accesses the application
Then the application should load within 3 seconds
@17
Scenario: Support for 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation
Given the application is deployed on cloud infrastructure
When 10,000 users access the application concurrently
Then the system should support all users without performance degradation
@17
Scenario: Ensure high availability and minimal downtime using cloud infrastructure
Given the application is deployed on cloud infrastructure
When there is an increase in traffic
Then the cloud infrastructure should ensure high availability and minimal downtime
@17
Scenario: Automatic scaling with increasing traffic
Given the application is deployed on cloud infrastructure
When there is an increase in traffic
Then the application should scale automatically
@17
Scenario: Monitoring and logging of performance metrics
Given the application is deployed on cloud infrastructure
When the application is in use
Then performance metrics should be monitored and logged for analysis
@17
Scenario: Display error messages for performance issues
Given the application encounters a performance issue
When the issue occurs
Then an error message should be displayed to the user
@17
Scenario: Responsive interface supporting high traffic
Given the application is deployed on cloud infrastructure
When there is high traffic
Then the interface should remain responsive
@17
Scenario: Scalability complies with industry standards
Given the application is deployed on cloud infrastructure
When the application is scaled
Then scalability should comply with industry standards
@17
Scenario: Logging scalability interactions for analytics
Given the application is deployed on cloud infrastructure
When scalability interactions occur
Then the system should log these interactions for analytics
@17
Scenario: Optimization of scalability for performance and responsiveness
Given the application is deployed on cloud infrastructure
When there is an increase in traffic
Then scalability should be optimized for performance and responsiveness
