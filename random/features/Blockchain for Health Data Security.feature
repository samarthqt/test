Feature: Blockchain for Health Data Security
Scenario: Granting and revoking access to medical records
Given a patient is logged into the system
When the patient grants access to their medical records to a healthcare provider
Then the healthcare provider should have access to the patient's medical records
When the patient revokes access to their medical records from a healthcare provider
Then the healthcare provider should no longer have access to the patient's medical records
Scenario: Ensuring data integrity and immutability
Given patient medical records are stored on the blockchain
When a record is added to the blockchain
Then the record should be immutable and maintain data integrity
Scenario: Logging access attempts and notifying patients of unauthorized access
Given the system is logging all access attempts
When an unauthorized access attempt is made to a patient's medical records
Then the patient should be notified of the unauthorized access attempt
Scenario: Compliance with healthcare data regulations
Given the system is handling patient medical records
Then the system must comply with healthcare data regulations such as HIPAA
Scenario: Secure data sharing between authorized healthcare providers
Given a healthcare provider has been authorized to access patient medical records
When the provider accesses the records
Then the data sharing should be secure
Scenario: User-friendly interface for managing data access permissions
Given a patient is logged into the system
When the patient wants to manage data access permissions
Then the system should provide a user-friendly interface for managing these permissions
Scenario: Providing audit trails for all data transactions
Given the system is processing data transactions
When a transaction is completed
Then an audit trail should be available for that transaction
Scenario: System performance under expected load conditions
Given the system is operating under expected load conditions
When multiple users access the system simultaneously
Then the system should perform efficiently without degradation
Scenario: Encrypting all data stored on the blockchain
Given patient medical records are stored on the blockchain
Then all data must be encrypted
Scenario: Handling errors gracefully and providing meaningful feedback
Given a user performs an action that results in an error
Then the system should handle the error gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the user
