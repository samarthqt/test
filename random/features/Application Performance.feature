Feature: Application Performance
Scenario: Application loads within 3 seconds on web version
Given the web version of the application is accessed
When the application is loaded under standard network conditions
Then the application should load within 3 seconds on average
Scenario: Application loads within 3 seconds on mobile version
Given the mobile version of the application is accessed
When the application is loaded under standard network conditions
Then the application should load within 3 seconds on average
Scenario: Application handles 10,000 concurrent users with acceptable performance
Given the application is accessed by 10,000 concurrent users
When the application is running under standard network conditions
Then the system should handle the load with less than 5% error rate
Scenario: Real-time performance metrics logging and monitoring
Given the application is being accessed by users
When performance metrics are generated
Then the performance metrics should be logged and monitored in real-time
Scenario: Automatic resource scaling based on user load
Given the user load on the application increases
When the system detects increased load
Then the system should automatically scale resources to accommodate the load
Scenario: Monthly stress tests to ensure performance benchmarks
Given it is the scheduled time for a monthly stress test
When the stress test is conducted
Then the application should meet the performance benchmarks
