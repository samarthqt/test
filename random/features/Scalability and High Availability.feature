Feature: Scalability and High Availability
Scenario: Verify application uses cloud infrastructure with auto-scaling capabilities
Given the application is deployed on a cloud platform
When the user base and traffic increase
Then the application should automatically scale resources to handle the increased load
Scenario: Ensure application downtime does not exceed 0.1% of total uptime annually
Given the application is running in a production environment
When the application uptime is monitored over a year
Then the total downtime should not exceed 0.1% of the total uptime
Scenario: Implement load balancing to distribute traffic efficiently
Given the application is receiving traffic from multiple users
When load balancing is configured
Then the traffic should be distributed efficiently across servers
Scenario: Ensure redundant systems are in place for high availability
Given the application infrastructure is set up
When a component fails
Then redundant systems should take over to maintain application availability
Scenario: Conduct regular testing of failover mechanisms
Given the application has failover mechanisms in place
When failover testing is performed regularly
Then the failover mechanisms should work correctly to ensure high availability
