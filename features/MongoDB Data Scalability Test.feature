Feature: MongoDB Data Scalability Test
""
Scenario: Test the scalability of MongoDB by inserting a large volume of data and ensuring performance efficiency
Given MongoDB server is installed and running
And MongoDB client or application interface is accessible
And a large dataset file (e.g., 1 million records) is available
""
When I open the MongoDB client or application interface
Then the MongoDB client or application interface is opened successfully
""
When I connect to the MongoDB server using the appropriate connection string
Then the connection to the MongoDB server is established successfully
""
"    When I create a new database named ""scaleDB"""
"    Then the database ""scaleDB"" is created successfully"
""
"    When I create a collection named ""scaleCollection"" within ""scaleDB"""
"    Then the collection ""scaleCollection"" is created successfully within ""scaleDB"""
""
"    When I prepare the large dataset file for insertion into ""scaleCollection"""
Then the large dataset file is prepared and ready for insertion
""
"    When I insert the large dataset into ""scaleCollection"""
"    Then the dataset is inserted successfully into ""scaleCollection"""
""
When I monitor the performance metrics (e.g., insertion time, CPU usage) during the data insertion process
Then the performance metrics are within acceptable limits, indicating efficient data handling
""
"    When I query ""scaleCollection"" to retrieve a subset of the inserted data"
Then the subset of data is retrieved successfully and promptly
""
"    When I perform a bulk update on a specific field in the dataset within ""scaleCollection"""
Then the bulk update is completed successfully without significant performance degradation
""
"    When I delete a subset of the dataset from ""scaleCollection"""
"    Then the subset of data is deleted successfully from ""scaleCollection"""
""
"    When I verify the remaining data in ""scaleCollection"" after deletion"
"    Then the remaining data in ""scaleCollection"" is accurate and consistent"
""
When I close the connection to the MongoDB server
Then the connection to the MongoDB server is closed successfully
