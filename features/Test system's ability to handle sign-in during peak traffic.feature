Feature: Test system's ability to handle sign-in during peak traffic
Scenario: Verify system's capability to process sign-in attempts efficiently during peak traffic
Given the server is under simulated peak load
And the user has a valid account with email "user@example.com" and password "validPassword123"
When the user navigates to the sign-in page
Then the sign-in page is displayed with email and password fields
When the user enters a valid email address in the email field
And the user enters a valid password in the password field
And the user clicks on the "Sign In" button
Then the user is successfully signed in, and the home page is displayed
When the system response time during sign-in is verified
Then the response time is within acceptable limits even during peak traffic
When the user logs out of the application
Then the user is logged out, and the sign-in page is displayed
When the process is repeated with different email and password combinations
Then the system consistently handles sign-in attempts during peak traffic
When sign-in is tested with multiple users simultaneously
Then the system handles concurrent sign-in attempts efficiently
When system logs are verified for any errors or slowdowns
Then no significant errors or performance issues are logged
When sign-in is tested with different network types (Wi-Fi, cellular) during peak traffic
Then the system performs consistently across different network types
When ensuring no data loss occurs during peak traffic sign-in attempts
Then no data loss occurs; user data remains intact
When verifying UI responsiveness during peak traffic
Then the UI remains responsive, and the user is informed of any delays
When testing the system's ability to prioritize sign-in requests during peak traffic
Then the system prioritizes sign-in requests appropriately
When checking for any session management issues during peak traffic
Then session management is handled correctly, with no issues
