Feature: Simulate Cloud Infrastructure Failure
@TC-251
Scenario: Identify critical components of the cloud infrastructure
Given access to the cloud infrastructure environment
When identifying the critical components
Then critical components are identified and documented
@TC-251
Scenario: Simulate a failure in one of the critical components
Given failure simulation scenarios and baseline performance metrics established
When simulating a failure in one of the critical components
Then the component becomes non-operational
@TC-251
Scenario: Monitor the system's response to the failure
Given performance thresholds
When monitoring the system's response to the failure
Then system triggers failover mechanisms to maintain performance
@TC-251
Scenario: Verify system operation without performance degradation
When verifying system operation during the failure
Then system maintains performance levels despite the failure
@TC-251
Scenario: Check for error logs or alerts generated during the failure
When checking for error logs or alerts during the failure
Then error logs and alerts are generated, indicating the failure and recovery actions
@TC-251
Scenario: Simulate recovery of the failed component
When simulating recovery of the failed component
Then component is restored to operational status
@TC-251
Scenario: Verify system returns to normal operation post-recovery
When verifying system operation post-recovery
Then system returns to normal operation with all services restored
@TC-251
Scenario: Analyze system performance metrics during failure and recovery
When analyzing system performance metrics during failure and recovery
Then performance metrics show minimal impact during failure
@TC-251
Scenario: Test user experience during the failure scenario
When testing user experience during the failure
Then user experience remains unaffected with no noticeable impact
@TC-251
Scenario: Verify effectiveness of redundancy mechanisms
When verifying redundancy mechanisms
Then redundancy mechanisms are effective in maintaining system performance
@TC-251
Scenario: Document areas for improvement in the failover process
When documenting areas for improvement in the failover process
Then areas for improvement are identified and documented
@TC-251
Scenario: Conduct a post-mortem analysis of the failure simulation
When conducting a post-mortem analysis of the failure simulation
Then post-mortem analysis is completed with actionable insights
@TC-251
Scenario: Verify all system alerts and notifications were received
When verifying system alerts and notifications
Then all alerts and notifications were received and acknowledged
@TC-251
Scenario: Inform all stakeholders of the test results
When ensuring stakeholders are informed of the test results
Then stakeholders are informed and briefed on the test outcomes
@TC-251
Scenario: Prepare a final report summarizing the test findings
When preparing a final report summarizing the test findings
Then final report is prepared and submitted for review
