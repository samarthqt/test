Feature: Verify system performance at exactly 10,000 concurrent users
@TC-236
Scenario: Initialize load testing tool
Given the load testing tool is configured and ready to simulate user load
When the script for simulating 10,000 concurrent users is initialized
Then the concurrent user count should be 10,000
@TC-236
Scenario: Start load test and monitor system performance
Given the load test is started
When system performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and network bandwidth are monitored in real-time
Then the expected response time threshold should be 200ms
@TC-236
Scenario: Verify response times during the load test
Given the load test is running
When response times are checked
Then response times should consistently be below 200ms
@TC-236
Scenario: Check for errors or failures in transaction processing
Given the load test is running
When transaction processing is monitored
Then no errors or failures should be observed
@TC-236
Scenario: Analyze system logs for performance warnings or errors
Given the load test is running
When system logs are analyzed
Then no warnings or errors related to performance degradation should be found
@TC-236
Scenario: Verify system maintains functional integrity
Given the load test is running
When system features are checked for accessibility
Then all system features should be accessible and functioning correctly
@TC-236
Scenario: Ensure database queries are optimized
Given the load test is running
When database queries are monitored
Then database queries should be optimized and not cause performance bottlenecks
@TC-236
Scenario: Monitor network traffic for congestion
Given the load test is running
When network traffic is monitored
Then network traffic should be smooth with no congestion
@TC-236
Scenario: Evaluate system scalability
Given the load test is running
When system scalability is evaluated
Then the system should demonstrate scalability and handle user load beyond 10,000 concurrent users
@TC-236
Scenario: Validate system recovery mechanisms
Given the load test is running
When system recovery mechanisms are checked
Then system recovery mechanisms should be validated and functional
@TC-236
Scenario: Assess impact on data consistency and integrity
Given the load test is running
When data consistency and integrity are assessed
Then data consistency and integrity should be maintained during concurrent user load
@TC-236
Scenario: Check system notifications for performance issues
Given the load test is running
When system notifications are checked
Then system notifications should be triggered appropriately for any performance issues
@TC-236
Scenario: Confirm effective management of user sessions
Given the load test is running
When user session management is checked
Then user sessions should be managed effectively with no drop-offs
@TC-236
Scenario: Review load test results against benchmarks
Given the load test is completed
When load test results are reviewed
Then load test results should align with expected performance benchmarks
@TC-236
Scenario: Document observations and recommendations
Given the load test is completed
When observations and recommendations are documented
Then observations and recommendations for performance improvement should be documented
