Feature: Verify Server-Side Data Processing Logic
""
Scenario: Ensure server-side data processing logic is correctly implemented and optimized using Node.js
Given Node.js and npm are installed on the system
And the project repository is cloned and available locally
"    When I open the terminal and navigate to the project directory using ""cd /path/to/project"""
Then the terminal should be open in the specified project directory
""
Scenario: Locate the endpoint for data processing
"    Given I open ""server.js"" using a text editor"
When I locate the endpoint that will handle data processing
"    Then the correct endpoint for data processing should be located in ""server.js"""
""
Scenario: Implement data processing logic
"    Given the necessary dependencies are installed using ""npm install"""
When I implement logic in the endpoint to process incoming data
Then data processing logic should be implemented successfully in the endpoint
""
Scenario: Add validation checks for incoming data
When I add validation checks for incoming data
Then validation checks should validate incoming data correctly
""
Scenario: Modify endpoint to return processed data
When I modify the endpoint to return processed data with an additional field 'status' set to 'processed'
Then the endpoint should return processed data as per the defined logic
""
Scenario: Start the server
"    When I start the server using the command ""node server.js"""
Then the server should start successfully without any errors
""
Scenario: Send POST request to the endpoint
Given I use a REST client like Postman
"    When I send a POST request with sample data to the endpoint URL ""http://localhost:3000/process"""
Then the POST request should be successfully sent to the endpoint
""
Scenario: Verify processed data in response
When I check the response for processed data
Then the 'status' field should be set to 'processed'
""
Scenario: Verify response status code
When I verify the response status code
Then the response status code should be 200 OK
""
Scenario: Validate JSON structure of processed response
When I validate the JSON structure of the processed response against the expected format
Then the JSON structure should match the expected processed format
""
Scenario: Check server logs for errors
When I check server logs for any errors related to data processing
Then server logs should not contain any errors related to data processing
""
Scenario: Test endpoint with invalid data
When I test the endpoint with invalid data (e.g., missing 'email' field)
Then the endpoint should return appropriate error messages for invalid data
""
Scenario: Verify server handles multiple requests
When I send concurrent requests to the server
Then the server should handle multiple requests efficiently without errors
""
Scenario: Document data processing logic
When I document the data processing logic and response details in the project documentation
Then data processing logic and response details should be documented for future reference
""
Scenario: Review and refactor code for optimization
When I review and refactor code for optimization
Then the code should be optimized and refactored as necessary for better performance
