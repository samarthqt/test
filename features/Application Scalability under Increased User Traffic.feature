Feature: Application Scalability under Increased User Traffic
@TC-250
Scenario: Initiate load testing tool and configure it for the application
Given the load testing tool is configured and ready to simulate user traffic
And simulated user traffic data is high
When load testing tools are configured
Then the application environment is ready for testing
@TC-250
Scenario: Start the simulation with a gradual increase in user traffic
Given user traffic begins to increase as per the configuration
When load testing scenarios are initiated
Then baseline performance metrics are established
@TC-250
Scenario: Monitor application performance metrics during traffic increase
Given application performance metrics are displayed and recorded
When performance thresholds are observed
Then the application's response to increased traffic is monitored
@TC-250
Scenario: Observe auto-scaling behavior during increased traffic
Given application instances scale up automatically in response to increased traffic
When user traffic continues to increase
Then the application handles increased traffic without performance degradation
@TC-250
Scenario: Document performance metrics at peak traffic
Given application continues to handle increased traffic
When performance metrics are recorded at peak traffic
Then metrics are documented for analysis
@TC-250
Scenario: Reduce user traffic gradually
Given user traffic decreases as per the configuration
When the simulation is adjusted
Then traffic levels begin to normalize
@TC-250
Scenario: Observe auto-scaling behavior during traffic decrease
Given application instances scale down automatically as traffic decreases
When user traffic is reduced
Then the application's response to decreased traffic is monitored
@TC-250
Scenario: Verify application returns to baseline performance metrics
Given application performance returns to baseline levels after traffic normalization
When traffic levels are stable
Then baseline performance metrics are confirmed
@TC-250
Scenario: Analyze recorded performance metrics for anomalies
Given performance metrics are analyzed
When anomalies are checked
Then no significant anomalies are detected
@TC-250
Scenario: Test application functionality during peak traffic
Given application functions correctly and efficiently under peak load conditions
When performance is assessed
Then application functionality is verified
@TC-250
Scenario: Verify application response time during peak traffic
Given application response time remains within acceptable limits
When response times are measured
Then performance under load is acceptable
@TC-250
Scenario: Check for any error logs or alerts generated during the test
Given no critical errors or alerts are generated during the test
When logs are reviewed
Then system stability is confirmed
@TC-250
Scenario: Assess user experience during the load test
Given user experience remains positive with no noticeable lag or issues
When user feedback is collected
Then user satisfaction is ensured
@TC-250
Scenario: Conclude the load test and document all findings
Given load test is concluded
When findings are documented
Then all results are reviewed and recorded
