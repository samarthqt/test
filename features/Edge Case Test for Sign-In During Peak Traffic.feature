Feature: Edge Case Test for Sign-In During Peak Traffic
Scenario: Assess system behavior during sign-in attempts at peak traffic conditions
Given the server is under maximum simulated peak load
And the user has a valid account with email "user@example.com" and password "validPassword123"
When peak traffic conditions are simulated
And the user navigates to the sign-in page
Then the sign-in page should display email and password fields
Scenario: Successful sign-in attempt at peak traffic
Given the user is on the sign-in page
When the user enters a valid email address "user@example.com" in the email field
And the user enters a valid password "validPassword123" in the password field
And the user clicks on the 'Sign In' button at the peak traffic moment
Then the system should process the sign-in attempt with potential delays
And response time may be delayed with appropriate messages displayed
Scenario: Handling simultaneous peak traffic from multiple users
Given multiple users attempt sign-in simultaneously at peak traffic
Then the system should handle concurrent peak traffic attempts efficiently
Scenario: Verify system logs for peak traffic handling
When peak traffic conditions are simulated
Then system logs should indicate handling of peak traffic conditions
Scenario: Prioritization of critical sign-in requests
When critical sign-in requests are made during peak traffic
Then the system should prioritize these requests appropriately
Scenario: Ensure no data loss during peak traffic sign-in attempts
When sign-in attempts are made during peak traffic
Then there should be no data loss and user data should remain intact
Scenario: Verify UI responsiveness during peak traffic
When the user navigates the UI during peak traffic
Then the UI should remain responsive and inform the user of any delays
Scenario: System recovery from peak traffic overload
When the system experiences peak traffic overload
Then it should recover and resume normal operations efficiently
Scenario: Session management during peak traffic
When sessions are managed during peak traffic
Then session management should be handled correctly with no issues
Scenario: Handling invalid credentials during peak traffic
Given the user enters invalid email or password during peak traffic
Then the system should handle invalid credentials gracefully and prompt retry
Scenario: Verify system's failover mechanisms during peak traffic
When peak traffic causes system overload
Then failover mechanisms should activate and manage the overload effectively
