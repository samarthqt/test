Feature: Simulate network latency and verify application error handling
@TC-313
Scenario: Verify application fails to load within 3 seconds under simulated network latency
Given the network simulation tool is launched
When the latency is set to 500ms
And a web browser navigates to the application URL "http://example.com"
Then the application fails to load within 3 seconds
And the error message "Network timeout, please try again later" is displayed
@TC-313
Scenario: Check application logs for network latency errors
Given the application fails to load due to network latency
Then application logs contain entries related to network timeout errors
@TC-313
Scenario: Reset network latency and verify successful application loading
Given the network latency is reset to normal
When the application page is refreshed
Then the application loads successfully without network latency
@TC-313
Scenario Outline: Simulate varying network latencies and verify application behavior
Given the network simulation tool is launched
When the latency is set to <latency>ms
And a web browser navigates to the application URL "http://example.com"
Then the application loading time varies with network latency
And error handling is consistent
Examples:
| latency |
| 100     |
| 200     |
| 300     |
@TC-313
Scenario: Simulate network disconnection and verify error message
Given the network is disconnected
When attempting to load the application
Then the application fails to load
And the appropriate error message is displayed
@TC-313
Scenario: Check browser console for network-related errors
Given the application fails to load due to network issues
Then the browser console displays network timeout errors
@TC-313
Scenario: Verify application's retry mechanism under network latency
Given the application encounters a network latency error
Then the application attempts to reload
@TC-313
Scenario: Test application behavior with different browser versions under simulated latency
Given various browser versions are used
When network latency is simulated
Then the application displays consistent error handling across browser versions
@TC-313
Scenario: Simulate latency using different network types and observe application behavior
Given different network types like WiFi, 3G, and 4G are used
When latency is simulated
Then the application's error handling is consistent across different network types
@TC-313
Scenario: Evaluate user experience when encountering network latency errors
Given network latency errors occur
Then user experience feedback indicates clear communication of network issues
@TC-313
Scenario: Assess application's documentation regarding network latency handling
Given the application documentation is reviewed
Then documentation provides clear guidelines on handling network latency errors
@TC-313
Scenario: Check for automated alerts triggered by network latency issues
Given network latency errors occur
Then automated alerts are sent to the support team
