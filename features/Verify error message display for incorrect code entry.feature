Feature: Verify error message display for incorrect code entry
Scenario: Display error message for incorrect code entry
Given User has a verification code prompt active
When User enters an incorrect verification code "654321" into the system
Then System displays an error message indicating incorrect code entry
Scenario: Allow user to retry entering the code
Given User sees an error message for incorrect code entry
When User retries entering the correct verification code "123456"
Then System accepts the correct code and grants access
Scenario: Check error message clarity and helpfulness
Given User sees an error message for incorrect code entry
Then Error message clearly states the issue and next steps
Scenario: Log incorrect code entry attempt
Given User enters an incorrect verification code
Then System logs the incorrect attempt with timestamp and user ID
Scenario: Handle multiple incorrect attempts
Given User enters multiple incorrect verification codes
Then System allows retries without locking the user out
Scenario: Ensure error message consistency across devices
Given User enters an incorrect verification code on different devices
Then Error message displays correctly on all devices
Scenario: System response during high traffic
Given High traffic condition occurs
When User enters an incorrect verification code
Then Error messages are displayed promptly without delay
Scenario: Prevent code entry after multiple incorrect attempts
Given User has made multiple incorrect verification code attempts
Then System prompts for alternative verification method after multiple failures
Scenario: Handle incorrect code entries with special characters
Given User enters a verification code with special characters
Then System rejects entries with special characters and displays a relevant error message
Scenario: Customize error messages based on user settings
Given User has customized error message settings
Then Error messages reflect user preferences where applicable
Scenario: Handle incorrect code entries from different geographic locations
Given User enters an incorrect verification code from different geographic locations
Then Error message displays consistently regardless of location
Scenario: System response during network delays
Given Network delay occurs
When User enters an incorrect verification code
Then Error message is displayed without network-induced delays
Scenario: Handle incorrect code entries with varying code lengths
Given User enters a verification code with incorrect length
Then System rejects codes of incorrect length and displays a relevant error message
Scenario: Concurrent incorrect code entries from multiple users
Given Multiple users enter incorrect verification codes concurrently
Then Each user's incorrect attempt is handled separately and accurately
