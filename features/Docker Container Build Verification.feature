Feature: Docker Container Build Verification
""
Scenario: Verify Docker can successfully build a container image from application source code
Given Docker is installed and running on the system
And the application source code and Dockerfile are available in the specified directory
When I open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the application source code and Dockerfile
Then the terminal should display the correct directory path
""
Scenario: Build Docker image
Given I am in the application source code directory
When I run the command `docker build -t myapp:latest .`
Then Docker should start building the image, displaying step-by-step build logs
""
Scenario: Verify successful build completion
When the Docker build process completes
Then the terminal should display a success message with the image ID
""
Scenario: List Docker images
When I run the command `docker images`
Then the image `myapp:latest` should be listed
""
Scenario: Inspect the built image
When I run the command `docker inspect myapp:latest`
Then detailed information about the image `myapp:latest` should be displayed, including configuration and history
""
Scenario: Start a container from the built image
When I run the command `docker run myapp:latest`
Then the container should start successfully, and the application should be running as expected
""
Scenario: Verify application functionality
When I access the application through its exposed interface (e.g., web browser or API client)
Then the application should respond correctly, demonstrating expected functionality
""
Scenario: Check container logs
When I run the command `docker logs <container_id>`
Then the logs should show normal operation of the application without errors
""
Scenario: Stop the running container
When I run the command `docker stop <container_id>`
Then the container should stop successfully without errors
""
Scenario: Remove the stopped container
When I run the command `docker rm <container_id>`
Then the container should be removed successfully from the list of Docker containers
""
Scenario: Remove the Docker image
When I run the command `docker rmi myapp:latest`
Then the image `myapp:latest` should be removed successfully from the list of Docker images
""
Scenario: Verify the image is no longer listed
When I run the command `docker images`
Then the image `myapp:latest` should not be listed in the output
""
Scenario: Clean up dangling images
When I run the command `docker image prune`
Then any dangling images should be removed, and a confirmation message should be displayed
""
Scenario: Document issues encountered
When issues are encountered during the build and run process
Then all issues should be documented with detailed descriptions and steps to reproduce
""
Scenario: Review for optimizations or improvements
When I review the Dockerfile and source code
Then suggestions for improvements should be documented and reviewed with the development team
