Feature: Test error message delivery at maximum network latency
Scenario: Assess the system's ability to deliver error messages under maximum network latency conditions
Given network latency testing tools are available
And the system can simulate maximum network latency conditions
When I set up the network latency simulation tool to introduce maximum latency
Then network latency is simulated at maximum level
When I navigate to the sign-in page
Then the sign-in page is displayed with fields for email and password
When I enter a valid email "user@example.com" in the email field
And I enter an incorrect password "IncorrectPassword123" in the password field
And I click the 'Sign In' button
Then the sign-in attempt is initiated
When I observe the system's response time for delivering the error message
Then the system takes longer to deliver the error message due to latency
When I verify if the error message is eventually delivered correctly
Then the error message is delivered correctly despite latency
When I check if the error message content is accurate and informative
Then the error message content is accurate and provides guidance
When I verify if the system logs the latency event for auditing
Then the latency event is logged in the system
When I attempt to sign in again with correct credentials under maximum latency
Then sign-in is successful if credentials are correct, despite latency
When I check if the system provides an option to retry the sign-in attempt
Then the option to retry sign-in is available (if applicable)
When I verify if the error message delivery is consistent across different browsers
Then the error message delivery is consistent on all tested browsers
When I check if the error message delivery is consistent across different devices
Then the error message delivery is consistent on all tested devices
When I validate that no sensitive information is exposed in the error message
Then the error message does not expose any sensitive information
When I evaluate if the system provides a warning about potential network issues
Then the system provides a warning or guidance about network latency
