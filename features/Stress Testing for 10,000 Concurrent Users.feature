Feature: Stress Testing for 10,000 Concurrent Users
@TC-234
Scenario: Conduct stress testing for handling 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation
Given access to the user simulation tool
When the concurrent user count is set to 10,000
Then concurrent user count is confirmed as 10,000
@TC-234
Scenario: Monitor server CPU usage during stress test
Given server monitoring tools are available
When the test is conducted
Then server CPU usage is monitored and recorded
@TC-234
Scenario: Open the application on the test device
Given the application is installed on the test device
When the application is opened
Then the application is successfully launched
@TC-234
Scenario: Perform various operations during stress test
Given the application is opened
When operations such as login, navigation, and data retrieval are performed
Then operations are completed successfully
@TC-234
Scenario: Measure response time during operations
Given operations are performed on the application
When response time for each operation is measured
Then response times are recorded
@TC-234
Scenario: Verify application performance under stress
Given 10,000 concurrent users are simulated
When application performance is monitored
Then application handles concurrent users without performance degradation
@TC-234
Scenario: Observe error messages or performance issues
Given application is under stress test
When monitoring for errors or issues
Then no error messages or performance issues are observed
@TC-234
Scenario: Check application's responsiveness during stress test
Given application is under stress test
When checking responsiveness
Then application remains responsive
@TC-234
Scenario: Log results of user simulation and application performance
Given user simulation and application performance are monitored
When the test concludes
Then results are logged
@TC-234
Scenario: Reset user simulation conditions
Given stress test is completed
When resetting user simulation conditions
Then conditions are reset to normal
@TC-234
Scenario Outline: Repeat test with different user counts
Given the user simulation tool is configured
When the test is repeated with <user_count> users
Then test results are recorded
Examples:
| user_count |
| 5000       |
| 15000      |
@TC-234
Scenario: Analyze impact of user counts on performance
Given test results for different user counts
When analyzing the impact
Then impact analysis is completed
@TC-234
Scenario: Document discrepancies or issues found
Given test results are available
When discrepancies or issues are identified
Then they are documented
@TC-234
Scenario: Provide recommendations for maintaining performance
Given analysis of test results
When recommendations are formulated
Then recommendations are provided
@TC-234
Scenario: Ensure application performs optimally under stress conditions
Given recommendations are implemented
When application is tested under simulated stress conditions
Then application performance is optimal
