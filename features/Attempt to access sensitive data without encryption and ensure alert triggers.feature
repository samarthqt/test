Feature: Attempt to access sensitive data without encryption and ensure alert triggers
@TC-238
Scenario: Simulate an attempt to access sensitive data without encryption
Given sensitive data is identified
When I simulate an attempt to access sensitive data without encryption
Then the access attempt is logged
And an alert is triggered
@TC-238
Scenario: Verify the alert system captures the unauthorized access attempt
Given the alert system is configured
When an unauthorized access attempt occurs
Then the alert system captures the unauthorized access attempt
@TC-238
Scenario: Check that the alert contains details of the access attempt
Given an alert is triggered
When I check the alert details
Then the alert contains user information and timestamp
@TC-238
Scenario: Ensure the system blocks the unauthorized access attempt
Given an unauthorized access attempt is detected
When the system processes the access request
Then the unauthorized access attempt is blocked
@TC-238
Scenario: Review system logs to confirm the access attempt and alert trigger
Given an access attempt and alert trigger
When I review the system logs
Then the system logs confirm the access attempt and alert trigger
@TC-238
Scenario: Validate alert communication to security personnel
Given an alert is triggered
When the alert is communicated
Then the alert is communicated to the appropriate security personnel
@TC-238
Scenario: Test system's ability to handle multiple unauthorized access attempts
Given multiple unauthorized access attempts occur simultaneously
When the system processes the access attempts
Then the system handles multiple unauthorized access attempts effectively
@TC-238
Scenario: Check for delays in alert generation or communication
Given an alert system is configured
When an unauthorized access attempt occurs
Then alerts are generated and communicated without delay
@TC-238
Scenario: Ensure alert system is resilient to false positives
Given the alert system is operational
When a false positive occurs
Then the alert system is resilient to false positives
@TC-238
Scenario: Verify alert system logs resolution of access attempt
Given an access attempt resolution
When the resolution is processed
Then the alert system logs the resolution of the access attempt
@TC-238
Scenario: Assess impact of unauthorized access attempts on system performance
Given unauthorized access attempts occur
When the system processes the attempts
Then unauthorized access attempts do not impact system performance
@TC-238
Scenario: Check system notifications for security breaches
Given a security breach is detected
When the system processes the breach
Then system notifications are triggered for security breaches
@TC-238
Scenario: Validate accuracy and reliability of the alert system
Given the alert system is operational
When an alert is triggered
Then the alert system is accurate and reliable
@TC-238
Scenario: Review user access logs to ensure unauthorized attempts are monitored
Given user access logs are available
When I review the logs
Then unauthorized access attempts are monitored and logged
@TC-238
Scenario: Document access attempt results and recommendations for alert system improvement
Given access attempt results are available
When I document the results
Then access attempt results are documented with recommendations for alert system improvement
