Feature: Simulate Database Connection Failure
@TC-290
Scenario: Ensure the application is running and connected to the database
Given the application is running
When the application connects to the database
Then the application is connected to the database successfully
@TC-290
Scenario: Simulate a database connection failure by providing an invalid connection string
Given the application is running
When an invalid database connection string is provided
Then the application fails to connect to the database
And logs an appropriate error message
@TC-290
Scenario: Check the application's error handling mechanism for database connection failures
Given the application fails to connect to the database
When an error occurs due to database connection failure
Then the application displays a user-friendly error message indicating the connection issue
@TC-290
Scenario: Attempt to perform a database operation during the connection failure
Given the application has a database connection failure
When a database operation is attempted
Then the operation fails gracefully
And the application does not crash
@TC-290
Scenario: Restore the correct database connection string
Given the application has a database connection failure
When the correct database connection string is restored
Then the application reconnects to the database successfully
@TC-290
Scenario: Verify the application's ability to resume normal operations post-reconnection
Given the application has reconnected to the database
When normal operations are resumed
Then the application performs database operations successfully
@TC-290
Scenario: Check application logs for any errors related to the database connection failure
Given the application has experienced a database connection failure
When checking application logs
Then appropriate error logs are present
And no additional errors are logged post-reconnection
@TC-290
Scenario: Simulate intermittent database connection failures
Given the application is connected to the database
When intermittent database connection failures are simulated
Then the application handles intermittent failures gracefully
And maintains stability
@TC-290
Scenario: Verify the application's retry mechanism for database connections
Given the application has a database connection failure
When retrying to connect to the database
Then the application retries connecting to the database as per the configured retry policy
@TC-290
Scenario: Simulate a long-term database outage
Given the application is connected to the database
When a long-term database outage is simulated
Then the application maintains stability during the outage
And logs appropriate error messages
@TC-290
Scenario: Check if the application provides alternative solutions or fallbacks during a database outage
Given the application is experiencing a database outage
When checking for alternative solutions or fallbacks
Then the application provides alternative solutions or fallbacks to maintain user experience
@TC-290
Scenario: Verify the application's performance during a database connection failure
Given the application is experiencing a database connection failure
When monitoring performance
Then the application's performance remains stable
And does not degrade significantly
@TC-290
Scenario: Simulate a database connection failure during peak load
Given the application is under peak load conditions
When a database connection failure is simulated
Then the application handles the failure gracefully
@TC-290
Scenario: Verify the application's error reporting mechanism for database connection issues
Given the application is experiencing database connection issues
When generating error reports
Then error reports are generated
And sent to the appropriate monitoring systems
@TC-290
Scenario: Test the application's ability to recover from a database connection failure
Given the application has experienced a database connection failure
When recovering from the failure
Then the application recovers from the failure
And resumes normal operations without data loss
