Feature: Test Platform Scalability with Sudden Increase in User Traffic
@TC-295
Scenario: Set up load testing environment
Given the environment is configured for load testing
And there are 10,000 simulated users
And there are 59 user accounts for simulation
@TC-295
Scenario: Simulate sudden increase in user traffic
Given a stable internet connection
When traffic is increased by 200%
Then the traffic increase is successfully simulated
@TC-295
Scenario: Monitor system performance metrics
Given the test duration is 1 hour
When monitoring CPU, memory, and response time
Then metrics are recorded accurately
@TC-295
Scenario: Evaluate system response under peak load
Given key actions include Login, Browse, Checkout
When system is under peak load
Then system remains stable and responsive
@TC-295
Scenario: Check for any system crashes or downtime
When monitoring system stability
Then no crashes or downtime occur
@TC-295
Scenario: Verify user experience during peak traffic
When evaluating user experience
Then user experience is consistent and satisfactory
@TC-295
Scenario: Test checkout process under high load
When performing checkout process under high load
Then checkout process completes successfully
@TC-295
Scenario: Analyze server logs for errors or warnings
When analyzing server logs
Then logs show no critical errors or warnings
@TC-295
Scenario: Simulate traffic from multiple geographic locations
When simulating traffic from different locations
Then system handles traffic efficiently
@TC-295
Scenario: Evaluate database performance under load
When evaluating database performance
Then database queries are executed without delay
@TC-295
Scenario: Test system's ability to scale resources dynamically
When testing resource scaling
Then resources are scaled dynamically as needed
@TC-295
Scenario: Verify load balancing effectiveness
When verifying load balancing
Then load is balanced across servers effectively
@TC-295
Scenario: Check for latency issues during peak traffic
When monitoring latency during peak traffic
Then no significant latency issues are observed
@TC-295
Scenario: Test platform's ability to recover from overload
When testing recovery from overload
Then platform recovers seamlessly
@TC-295
Scenario: Ensure system alerts are triggered for high resource usage
When monitoring for high resource usage
Then alerts are triggered appropriately
