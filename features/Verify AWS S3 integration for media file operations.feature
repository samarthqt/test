Feature: Verify AWS S3 integration for media file operations
@TC-315
Scenario: Log in to AWS S3 account and navigate to the specified bucket
Given an AWS S3 account is configured
When the user logs in to the AWS S3 account
And navigates to the example-bucket
Then the user is successfully logged in and navigated to the example-bucket
@TC-315
Scenario: Upload media file to AWS S3 bucket
Given the media file "test_image.jpg" exists
When the user uploads the media file "test_image.jpg" to the example-bucket
Then the media file "test_image.jpg" is successfully uploaded to the example-bucket
@TC-315
Scenario: Retrieve media file from AWS S3 bucket
Given the media file "test_image.jpg" is uploaded to the example-bucket
When the user retrieves the media file "test_image.jpg" from the example-bucket
Then the media file "test_image.jpg" is successfully retrieved from the example-bucket
@TC-315
Scenario: Verify integrity and security of retrieved media file
Given the media file "test_image.jpg" is retrieved from the example-bucket
When the user verifies the integrity and security of the media file
Then the retrieved media file is intact and secure
@TC-315
Scenario: Delete media file from AWS S3 bucket
Given the media file "test_image.jpg" is uploaded to the example-bucket
When the user deletes the media file "test_image.jpg" from the example-bucket
Then the media file "test_image.jpg" is successfully deleted from the example-bucket
@TC-315
Scenario: Confirm deletion of media file
Given the media file "test_image.jpg" is deleted from the example-bucket
When the user attempts to retrieve the deleted media file "test_image.jpg"
Then an error is returned, confirming the deletion
@TC-315
Scenario: Check AWS S3 logs for media file operations
Given media file operations are performed
When the user checks AWS S3 logs for entries related to media file operations
Then AWS S3 logs contain entries for upload, retrieve, and delete operations
@TC-315
Scenario: Verify access permissions for AWS S3 bucket
Given the example-bucket exists
When the user verifies access permissions for the AWS S3 bucket
Then access permissions are correctly configured for secure media file operations
@TC-315
Scenario: Test media file operations with different file types
Given different media files (PNG, MP4, PDF) exist
When the user performs media file operations on different file types
Then media file operations are successful for different file types
@TC-315
Scenario: Simulate network latency during media file operations
Given media file operations are performed
When network latency is simulated
Then media file operations remain secure and reliable under network latency
@TC-315
Scenario: Evaluate user experience during media file operations
Given media file operations are performed
When the user evaluates the user experience
Then user experience feedback indicates ease of use and security
@TC-315
Scenario: Assess application's documentation regarding AWS S3 integration
Given AWS S3 integration is implemented
When the user assesses the application's documentation
Then documentation provides clear guidelines on AWS S3 integration and media file operations
@TC-315
Scenario: Check for automated alerts triggered by media file operation errors
Given media file operation errors occur
When the user checks for automated alerts
Then automated alerts are sent to the support team upon media file operation errors
@TC-315
Scenario: Verify application's retry mechanism for failed media file operations
Given media file operation errors occur
When the user verifies the application's retry mechanism
Then the application attempts to retry failed media file operations
@TC-315
Scenario: Test application behavior with different AWS regions
Given AWS S3 integration is implemented
When the user tests application behavior with different AWS regions for media file operations
Then the application displays consistent media file operation performance across AWS regions
