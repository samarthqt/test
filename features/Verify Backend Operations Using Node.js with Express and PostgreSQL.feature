Feature: Verify Backend Operations Using Node.js with Express and PostgreSQL
@TC-288
Scenario: Set up the PostgreSQL database with sample records
Given the PostgreSQL database is accessible
When I set up the database with sample records
Then the database should be set up correctly with sample records
@TC-288
Scenario: Start the Node.js server with Express framework
Given the Node.js and Express environment is configured
When I start the Node.js server
Then the server should start without errors
@TC-288
Scenario: Connect to the PostgreSQL database from the Node.js application
Given the Node.js application is running
When I connect to the PostgreSQL database
Then the connection should be established successfully
@TC-288
Scenario: Perform a basic data retrieval operation using an API endpoint
Given the API endpoint for data retrieval is available
When I perform a data retrieval operation
Then the data should be retrieved successfully from the database
@TC-288
Scenario: Verify data integrity and correctness of retrieved data
Given data has been retrieved from the database
When I verify the retrieved data
Then the data should match the sample records in the database
@TC-288
Scenario: Perform a data insertion operation using an API endpoint
Given the API endpoint for data insertion is available
When I perform a data insertion operation
Then the data should be inserted successfully into the database
@TC-288
Scenario: Verify data integrity after insertion operation
Given data has been inserted into the database
When I verify the inserted data
Then the data should be correctly stored in the database
@TC-288
Scenario: Perform a data update operation using an API endpoint
Given the API endpoint for data update is available
When I perform a data update operation
Then the data should be updated successfully in the database
@TC-288
Scenario: Verify data integrity after update operation
Given data has been updated in the database
When I verify the updated data
Then the data should reflect changes in the database
@TC-288
Scenario: Perform a data deletion operation using an API endpoint
Given the API endpoint for data deletion is available
When I perform a data deletion operation
Then the data should be deleted successfully from the database
@TC-288
Scenario: Verify data integrity after deletion operation
Given data has been deleted from the database
When I verify the deleted data
Then the data should no longer exist in the database
@TC-288
Scenario: Test authentication and authorization mechanisms for API access
Given the API endpoints require authentication
When I attempt to access the API endpoints
Then only authenticated users should be able to access them
@TC-288
Scenario: Check error handling for invalid API requests
Given the API endpoints are accessible
When I send invalid API requests
Then appropriate error messages should be returned
@TC-288
Scenario: Monitor server performance during data operations
Given the server is running
When I perform data operations
Then the server performance should remain stable
@TC-288
Scenario: Document any issues found and report back to the development team
Given I am testing the backend operations
When I encounter any issues
Then I should document them clearly for further analysis and report to the development team
