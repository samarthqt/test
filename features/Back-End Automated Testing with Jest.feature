Feature: Back-End Automated Testing with Jest
""
Scenario: Implement and validate automated testing for the back-end using Jest
Given Node.js and npm are installed on the system
And Jest is installed in the project as a development dependency
And access to the version control system with necessary permissions
""
Scenario: Navigate to the back-end project directory
When I navigate to the back-end project directory
Then the terminal is in the correct project directory
""
Scenario: Verify Jest configuration
When I open the Jest configuration file (jest.config.js)
Then Jest is correctly configured with the necessary settings for the project
""
Scenario: Create a new test file
When I create a new test file named userAPI.test.js in the tests directory
Then a new test file is created successfully
""
Scenario: Write test cases for API endpoints
Given a sample API endpoint: /api/user
"    And sample user data for POST request: {""name"": ""John Doe"", ""email"": ""john.doe@example.com""}"
When I write a test case to check the GET /api/user endpoint
Then the test case is written to verify the GET /api/user endpoint functionality
""
When I write a test case to check the POST /api/user endpoint
Then the test case is written to verify the POST /api/user endpoint functionality
""
Scenario: Include assertions in test cases
When I ensure the test cases include assertions for expected status codes and response data
Then assertions are included in the test cases for status codes and response data
""
Scenario: Execute Jest test suite
When I run the Jest test suite using the command 'npm test'
Then Jest executes all test cases, and results are displayed in the terminal
""
Scenario: Verify test results and code coverage
When I verify the test results for API endpoints in the terminal
Then all test cases for API endpoints pass successfully
""
When I review the code coverage report generated by Jest
Then the code coverage report shows adequate coverage for the API endpoints
""
Scenario: Commit and push test file to version control
When I commit the test file to the version control system
Then the test file is committed successfully
""
When I push the committed test file to the remote repository
Then the test file is pushed to the remote repository without errors
""
When I check the remote repository to confirm the test file is present
Then the test file is present in the remote repository
""
Scenario: Review CI/CD pipeline logs
When I review the CI/CD pipeline logs (if applicable) to ensure tests are executed automatically
Then the CI/CD pipeline logs indicate that tests are executed automatically without errors
""
Scenario: Communicate test results to the development team
When I ensure the test results are communicated to the development team
Then the development team is informed of the test results and any issues found
""
Scenario: Document the testing process and results
When I document the testing process and results in the project documentation
Then the testing process and results are documented accurately in the project documentation
