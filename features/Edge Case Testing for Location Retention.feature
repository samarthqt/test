Feature: Edge Case Testing for Location Retention
Scenario: Test edge cases for location retention when navigating to the Menu screen
Given the user is logged into the application with username "username@example.com" and password "password123"
And location services are enabled on the device
When the user launches the application on a supported device
Then the application opens successfully and displays the home screen
When the user logs in using valid user credentials
Then the user is successfully logged in and the main dashboard is displayed
When the user ensures location services are enabled on the device
Then location services are confirmed as enabled
When the user navigates to the location selection screen
Then the location selection screen is displayed with available locations
When the user selects "Downtown Cafe" from the list of locations
Then the location is selected, and a confirmation prompt appears
When the user confirms the location selection
Then the system processes the selection and navigates to the Menu screen
When the user verifies the Menu screen is displayed with the selected location retained
Then the Menu screen displays options specific to "Downtown Cafe"
When the user simulates a device restart and reopens the application
Then the application retains the selected location after restart
When the user checks for any error messages or alerts regarding location retention
Then no error messages or alerts are displayed, indicating successful retention
When the user tests the scenario with a location that frequently changes availability
Then the system dynamically updates and retains the correct location
When the user attempts to select a location during a network interruption
Then the system handles the interruption gracefully and retains the last known location
When the user verifies the system's behavior during peak hours with location retention
Then the system maintains performance and retention accuracy during peak hours
When the user checks if the system logs location retention actions for audit purposes
Then location retention actions are logged in the system for auditing
When the user verifies the UI/UX consistency for location retention
Then UI/UX is consistent and adheres to design standards
When the user tests the scenario with a location that has recently changed status
Then the system updates and reflects the current status of the location
