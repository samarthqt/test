Feature: Simulate System Failure and Verify Failover Mechanisms
@TC-257
Scenario: Initiate a network failure simulation
Given the system is running in a stable state
When a network failure simulation is initiated
Then failover mechanisms should activate, redirecting traffic to backup systems
@TC-257
Scenario: Monitor system logs for failover activation confirmation
Given a simulated failure condition of server crash
When monitoring system logs
Then logs should display activation of failover mechanisms
@TC-257
Scenario: Simulate server crash
Given a simulated failure condition of server crash
When a server crash is simulated
Then the system should maintain availability by switching to secondary servers
@TC-257
Scenario: Verify database connection status post-failover
Given a simulated failure condition of database disconnection
When verifying database connection status post-failover
Then the database should reconnect to backup nodes
@TC-257
Scenario: Conduct a power outage simulation
Given a simulated failure condition of power outage
When a power outage simulation is conducted
Then backup power systems should engage, maintaining system operation
@TC-257
Scenario: Review application error handling during failover
Given a simulated failure condition of application error
When reviewing application error handling during failover
Then the application should continue functioning without interruption
@TC-257
Scenario: Check system performance metrics during failover
Given the system is under simulated failure conditions
When checking system performance metrics during failover
Then performance metrics should indicate stable operation despite failure
@TC-257
Scenario: Simulate a combination of failure conditions
Given multiple simulated failure conditions
When simulating a combination of failure conditions
Then failover mechanisms should handle multiple failures concurrently
@TC-257
Scenario: Evaluate user access and functionality during failover
Given the system is under failover conditions
When evaluating user access and functionality during failover
Then users should experience no disruption in service
@TC-257
Scenario: Test system recovery post-failover activation
Given failover mechanisms have been activated
When testing system recovery post-failover activation
Then the system should revert to primary operations seamlessly
@TC-257
Scenario: Validate failover mechanism logs for accuracy
Given the system has undergone failover
When validating failover mechanism logs
Then logs should accurately reflect failover events and actions taken
@TC-257
Scenario: Check alert notifications during failover
Given the system is under failover conditions
When checking alert notifications during failover
Then alerts should be sent to system administrators promptly
@TC-257
Scenario: Assess failover mechanism response time
Given failover mechanisms are activated
When assessing failover mechanism response time
Then response time should be within acceptable limits
@TC-257
Scenario: Verify the integrity of data during failover
Given the system is under failover conditions
When verifying the integrity of data during failover
Then data integrity should be preserved with no loss
@TC-257
Scenario: Simulate recovery from failover state
Given the system is in a failover state
When simulating recovery from failover state
Then the system should return to normal operation without issues
