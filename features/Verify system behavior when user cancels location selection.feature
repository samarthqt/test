Feature: Verify system behavior when user cancels location selection
Scenario: User cancels location selection process
Given the user is logged into the system
And the user is on the location selection screen
When the user selects "Location A" from the list
And the user clicks on the "Cancel" button
Then the location selection process is canceled
And no location is set in the system
And the system returns to the default state or previous screen
When the user attempts to access the Menu screen without selecting a location
Then access to the Menu screen is restricted or a prompt to select a location is shown
And no error messages should be displayed upon cancellation
And no errors or warnings are logged in the system
When the user repeats the cancellation process multiple times
Then the system consistently handles cancellation without errors
And the user can re-initiate location selection without issues
And no confirmation prompt is shown unless designed to do so
When the user tests cancellation in different browsers and devices
Then cancellation behaves consistently across all platforms
And session data remains intact
When the user performs rapid consecutive cancellations
Then the system handles rapid cancellations without crashing or errors
And no UI glitches or artifacts are present
