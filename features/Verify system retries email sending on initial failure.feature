Feature: Verify system retries email sending on initial failure
@TC-182
Scenario: Trigger email sending process
Given the system is configured to send emails
When an action is triggered that sends an email to "user@example.com"
Then the email sending process is initiated
@TC-182
Scenario: Simulate email server failure
Given the email server with retry capability
When a failure is simulated in the email server
Then the email sending fails initially with subject "Order Confirmation"
And the system logs the email sending failure with content "Order details and confirmation"
@TC-182
Scenario: Verify email retry after failure
Given the email sending failed initially
When the system retries sending the email after a specified interval
Then the email is successfully sent after retries
@TC-182
Scenario: User notification on email status
Given the email is successfully sent after retries
When the user checks their notifications

@TC-182
Scenario: Retry behavior for invalid email address
Given an attempt to send an email to an invalid address
When the system retries sending the email
Then it eventually fails with an error message
@TC-182
Scenario: Verify limited retry attempts
Given the system retries sending the email
When the retry attempts exceed the defined number
Then the system stops retrying
@TC-182
Scenario: Check logs for retry attempts
Given the system has retried sending the email
When checking the logs
Then logs contain detailed information on retry attempts and outcomes
@TC-182
Scenario: Handle multiple email failures concurrently
Given multiple email failures occur
When the system processes these failures
Then the system manages multiple email failures without performance degradation
@TC-182
Scenario: Successful email send on first retry
Given the email sending failed initially
When the system retries sending the email for the first time
Then the email is sent successfully
@TC-182
Scenario: Confirmation email after successful send
Given an email is successfully sent
When the system sends a confirmation
Then a confirmation email is sent to the user

Scenario: Email content consistency across retries
Given the system retries sending the email
When the email is successfully sent
Then the email content remains consistent across retries
@TC-182
Scenario: Configurable retry mechanism
Given the system administrator accesses the retry settings
When the administrator configures the retry mechanism
Then the retry mechanism settings are configurable by the administrator
