""
Scenario: Verify that the application can be successfully deployed on AWS using Docker
Given an AWS account with necessary permissions
And AWS CLI is installed and configured with access keys
And Docker is installed and configured on the local machine
When the user logs in to the AWS Management Console using valid credentials
Then the AWS Management Console should be accessible
""
When the user navigates to the Elastic Container Service (ECS) dashboard from the AWS services menu
Then the ECS dashboard should be displayed
""
When the user creates a new ECS cluster by selecting 'Create Cluster' and following the setup wizard
Then a new ECS cluster should be created successfully
""
When the user opens a terminal and authenticates Docker to the Amazon ECR registry using the command `aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <ECR_URI>`
Then Docker should be authenticated to the Amazon ECR registry successfully
""
When the user pushes the Docker image to Amazon ECR using the command `docker push <ECR_URI>/myapp:latest`
Then the Docker image should be pushed to Amazon ECR successfully
""
When the user creates a new task definition in ECS by selecting 'Task Definitions' and 'Create new Task Definition' using the pushed Docker image URI
Then a new task definition should be created successfully
""
When the user configures the task definition with necessary parameters such as CPU, memory, and network settings
Then the task definition should be configured with the specified parameters
""
When the user deploys the task definition to the ECS cluster by selecting 'Run Task' and choosing the created task definition
Then the application should be deployed successfully on the ECS cluster
""
When the user verifies the task status in the ECS cluster to ensure it is running
Then the task status should be 'RUNNING'
""
When the user retrieves the public IP or DNS of the running task from the ECS console
Then the public IP or DNS should be retrieved successfully
""
When the user accesses the application using the retrieved public IP or DNS in a web browser
Then the application should be accessible and display the home page
""
When the user performs a basic functionality test on the application to ensure it is working as expected
Then all basic functionalities of the application should work without errors
""
When the user checks the application logs in AWS CloudWatch for any errors or warnings
Then the application logs should not contain any critical errors or warnings
""
When the user verifies the application performance metrics in AWS CloudWatch
Then the application performance metrics should be within acceptable limits
