Feature: Test Backend Handling of Maximum Concurrent User Requests
@TC-291
Scenario: Configure the load testing tool with the maximum number of concurrent requests
Given the application is deployed and accessible
When I configure the load testing tool with the maximum number of concurrent requests
Then the load testing tool is configured successfully
@TC-291
Scenario: Start the load test with the configured parameters
Given the load testing tool is configured with parameters
When I start the load test
Then the load test starts and sends concurrent requests to the application
@TC-291
Scenario: Monitor the application's response time during the load test
Given the load test is running
When I monitor the application's response time
Then the application's response time remains within acceptable limits
@TC-291
Scenario: Check for any errors or timeouts during the load test
Given the load test is running
When I check for errors or timeouts
Then no errors or timeouts occur during the load test
@TC-291
Scenario: Verify the application's ability to handle peak load without crashing
Given the load test is running
When the application is under peak load
Then the application handles the peak load successfully without crashing
@TC-291
Scenario: Check the server's CPU and memory usage during the load test
Given the load test is running
When I check the server's CPU and memory usage
Then CPU and memory usage remain within acceptable limits
@TC-291
Scenario: Verify the application's load balancing mechanism
Given the load test is running
When I verify the load balancing mechanism
Then load is distributed evenly across servers
@TC-291
Scenario: Simulate a sudden spike in concurrent requests
Given the load test is running
When I simulate a sudden spike in concurrent requests
Then the application handles the sudden spike without degradation in performance
@TC-291
Scenario: Check the application's ability to maintain data integrity under load
Given the load test is running
When I check data integrity
Then data integrity is maintained with no loss or corruption
@TC-291
Scenario: Verify the application's logging mechanism under load
Given the load test is running
When I verify the logging mechanism
Then logs are generated accurately without any loss or delay
@TC-291
Scenario: Test the application's scalability under maximum load
Given the load test is running
When I test scalability
Then the application scales effectively to handle the maximum load
@TC-291
Scenario: Simulate a gradual increase in concurrent requests
Given the load test is running
When I simulate a gradual increase in concurrent requests
Then the application handles the gradual increase smoothly without performance issues
@TC-291
Scenario: Verify the application's recovery from high load conditions
Given the load test has completed
When I verify recovery
Then the application recovers quickly and resumes normal operations
@TC-291
Scenario: Check for any bottlenecks or performance issues identified during the load test
Given the load test has completed
When I check for bottlenecks or performance issues
Then no significant bottlenecks or performance issues are identified
@TC-291
Scenario: Analyze the test results and generate a performance report
Given the load test has completed
When I analyze the test results
Then a detailed performance report is generated highlighting the application's ability to handle maximum concurrent user requests
