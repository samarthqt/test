Feature: Verify Retry Mechanism for Confirmation Sending
@TC-175
Scenario: Simulate an order confirmation sending attempt with a network failure
Given the order confirmation sending feature is enabled
When an order confirmation sending attempt is made with a network failure
Then the initial sending attempt fails due to network issues
@TC-175
Scenario: Verify that the system logs the failure of the initial attempt
Given the initial sending attempt fails due to network issues
Then the failure is logged with details of the error
@TC-175
Scenario: Check if the system initiates a retry after the initial failure
Given the initial sending attempt fails due to network issues
When the system detects the failure
Then the system initiates a retry attempt automatically
@TC-175
Scenario: Ensure that the retry attempt is successful under normal network conditions
Given the system initiates a retry attempt automatically
When the network conditions return to normal
Then the retry attempt succeeds and confirmation is sent
@TC-175
Scenario: Verify that the confirmation email is received by the customer
Given the retry attempt succeeds and confirmation is sent
Then the customer receives the confirmation email
@TC-175
Scenario: Check if the confirmation includes order number, shipping address, and items purchased
Given the customer receives the confirmation email
Then the confirmation email includes order number, shipping address, and items purchased
@TC-175
Scenario: Verify that the retry attempt is logged for auditing purposes
Given the retry attempt succeeds and confirmation is sent
Then the retry attempt is logged with success details
@TC-175
Scenario: Ensure that the system does not send duplicate confirmations
Given the retry attempt succeeds and confirmation is sent
Then only one confirmation email is sent successfully
@TC-175
Scenario: Check if the system provides a notification to the user about the retry
Given the system initiates a retry attempt automatically
Then the user is notified of the retry attempt
@TC-175
Scenario: Verify that the system can handle multiple retry scenarios without performance issues
Given multiple retry scenarios occur
Then the system performs retries without affecting performance
@TC-175
Scenario: Ensure that retries are attempted within a reasonable time frame
Given the system initiates a retry attempt automatically
Then retries occur within the configured time frame
@TC-175
Scenario: Check if the system provides an option to manually resend confirmation if retries fail
Given the system initiates a retry attempt automatically
When retries fail
Then a manual resend option is available if needed
@TC-175
Scenario: Verify that the system handles retries gracefully with no user impact
Given the system initiates a retry attempt automatically
Then users are not negatively impacted by retry attempts
@TC-175
Scenario: Ensure that the system provides clear logs for all retry attempts
Given the system initiates a retry attempt automatically
Then logs are clear and provide details of each retry attempt
@TC-175
Scenario: Check if the system can handle simultaneous retry attempts for multiple users
Given multiple users require retry attempts simultaneously
Then the system handles multiple retries simultaneously without issues
