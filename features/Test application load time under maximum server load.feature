Feature: Test application load time under maximum server load
@TC-314
Scenario: Measure application load time under maximum server load
Given the server load testing tool is launched
And server load is set to maximum capacity
When I open a web browser and navigate to the application URL
Then the application should load completely within 3 seconds
And no performance degradation or errors should be observed during loading
@TC-314
Scenario: Verify application logs for server load entries
Given the application is loaded under maximum server load
When I check the application logs
Then the logs should contain entries related to server load conditions
@TC-314
Scenario: Reset server load and verify application load
Given the server load is set to maximum capacity
When I reset server load to normal and refresh the application page
Then the application should load successfully without server load issues
@TC-314
Scenario: Simulate varying server loads and verify application performance
Given the server load testing tool is launched
When I simulate varying server loads at 75%, 50%, and 25%
Then the application loading time should vary with server load
And performance should remain stable
@TC-314
Scenario: Simulate server overload and verify application response
Given the server load testing tool is launched
When I simulate a server overload and attempt to load the application
Then the application should fail to load
And an appropriate error message should be displayed
@TC-314
Scenario: Check browser console for server load-related errors
Given the server load is set to maximum capacity
When I check the browser console
Then the console should display server load errors
@TC-314
Scenario: Verify application's retry mechanism under server load
Given the application fails to load due to server load error
When I observe the application's behavior
Then the application should attempt to reload after server load error
@TC-314
Scenario: Test application behavior with different browser versions
Given the server load is set to maximum capacity
When I test the application with different browser versions
Then the application should display consistent performance across browser versions
@TC-314
Scenario: Simulate server load using different server types
Given the server load testing tool is launched
When I simulate server load using cloud, dedicated, and shared server types
Then the application's performance should be consistent across different server types
@TC-314
Scenario: Evaluate user experience under server load issues
Given the server load is set to maximum capacity
When users encounter server load issues
Then user experience feedback should indicate clear communication of server load issues
@TC-314
Scenario: Assess application's documentation regarding server load handling
Given the server load is set to maximum capacity
When I review the application's documentation
Then the documentation should provide clear guidelines on handling server load issues
@TC-314
Scenario: Check for automated alerts triggered by server load issues
Given the server load is set to maximum capacity
When server load errors occur
Then automated alerts should be sent to the support team upon server load errors
