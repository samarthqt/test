Feature: Test system recovery from network failure during sign-in
Scenario: Verify system recovery and successful sign-in after network failure
Given the user has a valid account
And the network connection is initially stable
When the user navigates to the sign-in page
Then the sign-in page is displayed with email and password fields
Scenario: Enter valid credentials and simulate network failure
Given the user is on the sign-in page
When the user enters a valid email address in the email field
And the user enters a valid password in the password field
Then the email and password are entered successfully
Scenario: Simulate network failure during sign-in
Given the user has entered valid credentials
When the network failure simulation tool is used to simulate a network failure
Then the network connection is interrupted
Scenario: Attempt sign-in during network failure
Given the network connection is interrupted
When the user attempts to click on the 'Sign In' button
Then the system displays a network error message
Scenario: Restore network connection and re-attempt sign-in
Given the network connection is interrupted
When the network connection is restored
And the user re-attempts to click on the 'Sign In' button
Then the user is successfully signed in, and the home page is displayed
Scenario: Verify active session and user data
Given the user is signed in successfully
When the user verifies the session
Then the user session is active, and data is displayed correctly
Scenario: Log out and repeat process with different credentials
Given the user is signed in
When the user logs out of the application
Then the user is logged out, and the sign-in page is displayed
Scenario: System recovery from network failure with different credentials
Given different email and password combinations
When the user repeats the sign-in process
Then the system consistently recovers from network failure and allows sign-in
Scenario: Handle prolonged network failure
Given a prolonged network failure is simulated
When the user attempts to sign in
Then the system handles prolonged network failure gracefully and prompts the user to retry
Scenario: Check system logs for network failure errors
Given network failure has occurred
When the user checks the system logs
Then relevant error entries are logged for auditing
Scenario: Test sign-in with different network types
Given different network types (Wi-Fi, cellular)
When the user attempts to sign in
Then the system recovers and allows sign-in across different network types
Scenario: Verify UI responsiveness during network failure and recovery
Given network failure and recovery occur
When the user interacts with the UI
Then the UI remains responsive, and the user is informed of network status
Scenario: Ensure no data loss during network failure
Given network failure occurs
When the system recovers
Then no data loss occurs; user data remains intact after recovery
