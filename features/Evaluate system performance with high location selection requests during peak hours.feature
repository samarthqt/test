Feature: Evaluate system performance with high location selection requests during peak hours
Scenario: System handles numerous location selection requests during peak hours
Given the user is logged into the application
And location services are enabled
And peak hours are defined
When the user launches the application and logs in using valid credentials
Then the user is logged into the application successfully
Scenario: Navigate to location selection screen
When the user navigates to the location selection screen
Then the location selection screen is displayed
Scenario: Select locations during peak hours
When the user selects Location A during peak hours
Then Location A is selected
And the system responds promptly despite high request volume
When the user repeats the selection for Location B during peak hours
Then Location B is selected
And the system responds promptly despite high request volume
When the user repeats the selection for Location C during peak hours
Then Location C is selected
And the system responds promptly despite high request volume
Scenario: Verify system logs and stability
When the user verifies system logs for any errors related to high request volume
Then logs indicate high request volume but no errors
When the user checks system stability during peak hours
Then the system remains stable and responsive during peak hours
Scenario: Perform other actions during peak hours
When the user attempts to perform other actions within the app during peak hours
Then other actions are unaffected by high request volume
Scenario: Log out and test with different user account
When the user logs out from the application
Then the user is logged out successfully
When the user repeats the test with a different user account
Then the system behaves consistently across different user accounts
Scenario: Check for error messages or logs
When the user checks for any error messages or logs generated during high request volume
Then no unexpected error messages or logs are generated
Scenario: Verify network reconnection prompts
When the user attempts to access network-dependent features
Then the system correctly prompts the user to reconnect to the network
Scenario: Verify system recovery and performance under network conditions
When the network connection is restored
Then the system recovers and functions normally with network connection restored
When the user verifies system performance under varying network conditions during peak hours
Then the system performs optimally under all network conditions during peak hours
