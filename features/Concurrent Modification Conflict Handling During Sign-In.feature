Feature: Concurrent Modification Conflict Handling During Sign-In
Scenario: Check system response to concurrent modification conflicts during sign-in
Given User A has access to the shared account credentials
And User B has access to the shared account credentials
And User A navigates to the sign-in page
Then the sign-in page is displayed for User A
When User A enters the shared email "shared@example.com" and password "SharedPassword123"
And User A clicks the "Sign In" button
Then the sign-in attempt is initiated for User A
And simultaneously, User B navigates to the sign-in page
Then the sign-in page is displayed for User B
When User B enters the same shared email "shared@example.com" and password "SharedPassword123"
And User B clicks the "Sign In" button
Then the sign-in attempt is initiated for User B
And the system detects a concurrent modification conflict
Then an error message is displayed indicating a concurrent sign-in attempt
And only one user is able to sign in successfully
And the system logs the concurrent modification conflict for auditing
Scenario: Resolve concurrent modification conflict
Given a concurrent modification conflict was detected
When a user attempts to sign in again with the same credentials after resolving the conflict
Then sign-in is successful if no concurrent conflict exists
And the system provides guidance on resolving concurrent sign-in conflicts
Scenario: Consistency of conflict handling across platforms
Given the system handles concurrent modification conflicts
When conflict handling is tested across different browsers
Then conflict handling is consistent on all tested browsers
Scenario: Consistency of conflict handling across devices
Given the system handles concurrent modification conflicts
When conflict handling is tested across different devices
Then conflict handling is consistent on all tested devices
Scenario: Security of conflict error message
Given a concurrent modification conflict occurs
When an error message is displayed
Then the error message does not expose any sensitive information
