Feature: Ensure error message consistency across different browsers
Scenario: Verify error message consistency across browsers
Given the system is configured to display error messages
When the user navigates to the sign-in page using Chrome
Then the sign-in page is displayed on Chrome
When the user enters an invalid email and password
Then the fields accept input
When the user clicks 'Sign In' and observes the error message
Then an error message is displayed
When the user repeats steps 1-3 using Firefox
Then the error message is consistent with Chrome
When the user repeats steps 1-3 using Safari
Then the error message is consistent with Chrome
When the user repeats steps 1-3 using Edge
Then the error message is consistent with Chrome
Then verify error message content and format
And content and format are consistent across browsers
Then check for any browser-specific error message issues
And no browser-specific issues are found
Then verify system logs for error messages across browsers
And logs accurately reflect error messages
Then check error message consistency during high traffic conditions
And error messages remain consistent
Then test error message consistency with different screen resolutions
And error messages are consistent across resolutions
Then verify error messages under high latency conditions
And error messages remain consistent
Then check for any discrepancies in error message language
And language is consistent across browsers
Then verify error message consistency during server downtime
And error messages remain consistent
Then test error message consistency with different network speeds
And error messages are consistent across speeds
