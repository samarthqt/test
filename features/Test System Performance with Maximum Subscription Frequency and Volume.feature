Feature: Test System Performance with Maximum Subscription Frequency and Volume
To ensure the system can handle maximum subscription frequency and volume without performance degradation.
@TC-368
Scenario: Log in to the system with an admin account
Given I have access to the subscription system
When I log in to the system with an admin account
Then the admin dashboard is displayed with options to manage subscriptions
@TC-368
Scenario: Navigate to the subscription management section
Given the admin dashboard is displayed
When I navigate to the subscription management section
Then the subscription management interface is displayed
@TC-368
Scenario: Select a test user account for subscription testing
Given the subscription management interface is displayed
When I select a test user account for subscription testing
Then user account details are displayed
@TC-368
Scenario: Configure the subscription to the maximum allowable frequency
Given user account details are displayed
When I configure the subscription to the maximum allowable frequency (e.g., daily)
Then subscription frequency is set to daily
@TC-368
Scenario: Set the subscription volume to the maximum allowable limit
Given subscription frequency is set to daily
When I set the subscription volume to the maximum allowable limit
Then subscription volume is set to the maximum limit
@TC-368
Scenario: Save the subscription configuration
Given subscription volume is set to the maximum limit
When I save the subscription configuration
Then subscription settings are saved successfully
@TC-368
Scenario: Monitor system performance metrics during peak subscription times
Given subscription settings are saved successfully
When I monitor system performance metrics (CPU, memory, response time) during peak subscription times
Then system performance metrics remain within acceptable limits
@TC-368
Scenario: Simulate multiple users subscribing at the maximum frequency and volume
Given system performance metrics remain within acceptable limits
When I simulate multiple users subscribing at the maximum frequency and volume
Then system handles the load without degradation in performance
@TC-368
Scenario: Check for any error logs or alerts generated during the test
Given system handles the load without degradation in performance
When I check for any error logs or alerts generated during the test
Then no critical errors or alerts are generated
@TC-368
Scenario: Verify the accuracy of subscription data processed during the test
Given no critical errors or alerts are generated
When I verify the accuracy of subscription data processed during the test
Then subscription data is accurate and consistent
@TC-368
Scenario: Repeat the test with different subscription plans and user accounts
Given subscription data is accurate and consistent
When I repeat the test with different subscription plans and user accounts
Then system consistently handles maximum load across different scenarios
@TC-368
Scenario: Analyze the system's response time and throughput during the test
Given system consistently handles maximum load across different scenarios
When I analyze the system's response time and throughput during the test
Then response time and throughput remain within acceptable limits
@TC-368
Scenario: Evaluate system's ability to recover from any potential overload conditions
Given response time and throughput remain within acceptable limits
When I evaluate system's ability to recover from any potential overload conditions
Then system recovers gracefully without data loss or corruption
@TC-368
Scenario: Document any performance bottlenecks or issues observed
Given system recovers gracefully without data loss or corruption
When I document any performance bottlenecks or issues observed
Then a detailed report of performance observations and recommendations is generated
@TC-368
Scenario: Conclude the test with a summary of findings and potential improvements
Given a detailed report of performance observations and recommendations is generated
When I conclude the test with a summary of findings and potential improvements
Then a summary report is generated with actionable insights
