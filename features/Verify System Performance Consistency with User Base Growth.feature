@TC-255
Scenario: Simulate user base growth to 1500 users
Given the initial user base is 1000
When I simulate user base growth to 1500 users
Then the system performance remains consistent with 1500 users
@TC-255
Scenario: Monitor system performance metrics during growth
Given expected user base growth to 5000
When I monitor system performance metrics during growth
Then performance metrics indicate stable system operation
@TC-255
Scenario: Simulate user base growth to 3000 users
Given peak traffic simulation is enabled
When I simulate user base growth to 3000 users
Then the system performance remains consistent with 3000 users
@TC-255
Scenario: Verify system response to peak traffic conditions
