Feature: Validate system error detection for incorrect mappings in ZOTC_CROSSREFTAB

  @TC-70
  Scenario: User logs into the SAP S/4HANA system and accesses the configuration settings
    Given the user has appropriate credentials
    When the user logs into the SAP S/4HANA system
    Then the user is successfully logged in and has access to the configuration settings

  @TC-70
  Scenario: User navigates to the cross-reference table ZOTC_CROSSREFTAB
    Given the user is logged into the SAP S/4HANA system
    When the user navigates to the configuration settings for the cross-reference table ZOTC_CROSSREFTAB
    Then the cross-reference table ZOTC_CROSSREFTAB is displayed

  @TC-70
  Scenario: User introduces an incorrect mapping for a billing document type
    Given the user has access to the configuration settings
    When the user introduces an incorrect mapping for the billing document type "ZG2C"
    Then the incorrect mapping is successfully saved in the table

  @TC-70
  Scenario: User triggers end-to-end data transmission to Model N
    Given an incorrect mapping exists in the cross-reference table ZOTC_CROSSREFTAB
    When the user triggers the end-to-end data transmission to Model N
    Then the data transmission process is initiated

  @TC-70
  Scenario: System logs errors related to the incorrect mapping
    Given the data transmission process is initiated
    When the user monitors system logs and error reports for data transmission issues
    Then the system logs display errors related to the incorrect mapping

  @TC-70
  Scenario: System identifies the specific incorrect mapping in ZOTC_CROSSREFTAB
    Given the system logs display errors related to the incorrect mapping
    When the user verifies the error logs
    Then the error log explicitly identifies the incorrect mapping for "ZG2C"

  @TC-70
  Scenario: Data transmission fails for the incorrectly mapped document type
    Given the system identifies the incorrect mapping
    When the user verifies the data transmission status for "ZG2C"
    Then the data transmission is blocked for "ZG2C" and no data corruption occurs in Model N

  @TC-70
  Scenario: System generates error messages with actionable details
    Given the data transmission is blocked for the incorrectly mapped document type
    When the user checks the error messages generated by the system
    Then the error messages are clear and provide actionable details for correction

  @TC-70
  Scenario: Other mappings in the cross-reference table remain unaffected
    Given an incorrect mapping exists in the cross-reference table ZOTC_CROSSREFTAB
    When the user checks other mappings in the table
    Then other mappings in ZOTC_CROSSREFTAB function correctly without errors

  @TC-70
  Scenario: System prompts the user to correct the incorrect mapping
    Given the system identifies the incorrect mapping
    When the user reviews system notifications
    Then the system displays a prompt or notification to rectify the incorrect mapping

  @TC-70
  Scenario: User updates the incorrect mapping to a valid flow
    Given the system prompts the user to correct the mapping
    When the user updates the incorrect mapping to a valid flow and saves the changes
    Then the mapping is successfully updated and the system accepts the changes

  @TC-70
  Scenario: User re-triggers data transmission to confirm resolution
    Given the incorrect mapping is updated to a valid flow
    When the user re-triggers the data transmission
    Then the data transmission is successful and no errors are logged for "ZG2C"
