Feature: Verify SSL/TLS encryption for sensitive data during transactions
@TC-17
Scenario: Access the transaction module securely
Given SSL/TLS certificates are installed on the server
When I access the transaction module with a test user account
Then the user should be able to access the module securely
@TC-17
Scenario: Initiate a transaction with sensitive data input
Given I have access to the transaction module
When I initiate a transaction with sensitive data input
Then the transaction should begin without exposing sensitive data
@TC-17
Scenario: Monitor network traffic for SSL/TLS encryption
Given a transaction is initiated
When I monitor network traffic
Then data packets should be encrypted using SSL/TLS
@TC-17
Scenario: Verify encryption status using network monitoring tools
Given a transaction is in progress
When I check the encryption status using network monitoring tools
Then encryption should be active and consistent
@TC-17
Scenario: Complete the transaction and check for data security
Given a transaction is initiated
When I complete the transaction
Then sensitive data should remain encrypted throughout the transaction
@TC-17
Scenario: Attempt to intercept data during transaction
Given a transaction is in progress
When I attempt to intercept data using network sniffing tools
Then data should be inaccessible and encrypted
@TC-17
Scenario: Review transaction logs for encryption confirmation
Given a transaction is completed
When I review the transaction logs
Then logs should confirm encrypted data transmission
@TC-17
Scenario: Simulate a network attack and verify encryption integrity
Given a transaction is in progress
When I simulate a network attack
Then encryption should withstand the attack without data exposure
@TC-17
Scenario: Check SSL/TLS certificate validity during transaction
Given a transaction is initiated
When I check SSL/TLS certificate validity
Then certificates should be valid and correctly configured
@TC-17
Scenario: Test transaction with expired SSL/TLS certificates
Given SSL/TLS certificates are expired
When I initiate a transaction
Then the transaction should fail or warn about expired certificates
@TC-17
Scenario: Verify encryption compliance with industry standards
Given a transaction is in progress
When I verify encryption compliance
Then encryption should meet or exceed industry standards
@TC-17
Scenario: Check for errors or warnings related to SSL/TLS during transaction
Given a transaction is in progress
When I check for errors or warnings related to SSL/TLS
Then no errors or warnings should occur
@TC-17
Scenario: Review system settings for SSL/TLS encryption configurations
Given a transaction is initiated
When I review system settings for SSL/TLS encryption configurations
Then settings should be correctly configured for encryption
@TC-17
Scenario: Test transaction in different network environments
Given a transaction is initiated
When I test the transaction in different network environments
Then encryption should remain intact regardless of network environment
@TC-17
Scenario: Ensure encryption does not impact transaction speed
Given a transaction is initiated
When I complete the transaction
Then the transaction should complete in a timely manner without delays
