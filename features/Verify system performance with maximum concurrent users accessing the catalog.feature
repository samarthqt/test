Feature: Verify system performance with maximum concurrent users accessing the catalog
@TC-63
Scenario: Initiate concurrent user sessions accessing the product catalog
Given the system is prepared for maximum concurrent user load
When concurrent user sessions are initiated to access the product catalog
Then the system handles multiple user sessions without crashing
And the product catalog must be accessible
@TC-63
Scenario: Monitor system resources during peak load
Given the system is under peak load conditions
When system resources are monitored
Then system resources are utilized efficiently without bottlenecks
@TC-63
Scenario: Verify response time for each user session
Given multiple user sessions are active
When the response time for each session is measured
Then the response time remains within acceptable limits for all sessions
@TC-63
Scenario: Check UI responsiveness for each user session
Given multiple user sessions are active
When the UI responsiveness is checked for each session
Then the UI remains responsive and functional for all users
@TC-63
Scenario: Attempt to access product details during peak load
Given the system is under peak load
When users attempt to access product details
Then product details are accessible without delay
@TC-63
Scenario: Observe system logs for any errors or warnings
Given concurrent access is occurring
When system logs are observed
Then system logs do not contain critical errors related to concurrent access
@TC-63
Scenario: Validate system's ability to recover from peak load
Given the system has been under peak load
When the load decreases
Then the system recovers swiftly and continues to function optimally post-peak load
@TC-63
Scenario: Test system performance across different network conditions
Given varying network conditions
When system performance is tested
Then the system performs consistently across varying network conditions
@TC-63
Scenario: Verify system scalability to accommodate additional users
Given the current user load
When additional users are added
Then the system scales efficiently to handle additional user load
@TC-63
Scenario: Log out all user sessions
Given multiple user sessions are active
When all user sessions are logged out
Then all users are successfully logged out without errors
@TC-63
Scenario: Repeat performance test using different user accounts
Given different user accounts
When performance tests are repeated
Then system performance is consistent across different user accounts
@TC-63
Scenario: Test performance across different browsers
Given supported browsers
When system performance is tested on each browser
Then the system performs consistently on all supported browsers
@TC-63
Scenario: Test performance on mobile devices
Given mobile devices during peak load
When system performance is tested
Then the system performs optimally on mobile devices
@TC-63
Scenario: Simulate network latency during peak load
Given peak load conditions
When network latency is simulated
Then the system handles network latency gracefully without significant performance degradation
@TC-63
Scenario: Check system's ability to handle unexpected spikes in user load
Given unexpected spikes in user load
When the system is tested
Then the system manages unexpected spikes efficiently without crashing
