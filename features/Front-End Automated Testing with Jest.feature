Feature: Front-End Automated Testing with Jest
""
Scenario: Implement and validate automated testing for the front-end using Jest
Given Node.js and npm are installed on the system
And the front-end project is set up with Jest installed as a dependency
And access to the version control system (e.g., Git) with appropriate permissions
""
When I navigate to the front-end project directory
Then the terminal should be in the correct project directory
""
When I open the Jest configuration file (jest.config.js) to verify Jest settings
Then Jest should be correctly configured with the necessary settings for the project
""
When I create a new test file named ButtonComponent.test.js in the components directory
Then a new test file should be created successfully
""
When I write a test case to check if the ButtonComponent renders correctly
Then the test case should be written to check the rendering of the ButtonComponent
""
When I write a test case to simulate a button click event on the ButtonComponent
Then the test case should be written to simulate and verify the button click event
""
When I run the Jest test suite using the command 'npm test'
Then Jest should execute all test cases, and results should be displayed in the terminal
""
When I verify the test results for ButtonComponent in the terminal
Then all test cases for ButtonComponent should pass successfully
""
When I review the code coverage report generated by Jest
Then the code coverage report should show adequate coverage for the ButtonComponent
""
When I stage the test file changes for commit using the command 'git add components/ButtonComponent.test.js'
Then the test file changes should be staged successfully
""
"    When I commit the test file to the version control system using the command 'git commit -m ""Add test for ButtonComponent""'"
Then the test file should be committed successfully
""
When I verify the commit by checking the commit history using 'git log'
Then the commit for the test file should be present in the commit history
""
When I push the committed test file to the remote repository using the command 'git push origin main'
Then the test file should be pushed to the remote repository without errors
""
When I verify the push by checking the remote repository for the latest changes
Then the remote repository should reflect the committed test file changes
""
When I review the remote repository's CI/CD pipeline (if applicable) to ensure the tests are executed automatically
Then the CI/CD pipeline should execute the tests successfully without errors
""
When I document any issues found during testing and provide feedback to the development team
Then all issues should be documented, and feedback should be communicated to the development team
