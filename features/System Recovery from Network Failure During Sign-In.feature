Feature: System Recovery from Network Failure During Sign-In
To assess system behavior when network failure occurs at critical points during the sign-in process.
Scenario: Edge case test for system recovery from network failure during sign-in
Given the user has a valid account
And the network connection is initially stable
When the user navigates to the sign-in page
Then the sign-in page is displayed with email and password fields
When the user enters a valid email address in the email field
Then the email is entered successfully
When the user enters a valid password in the password field
Then the password is entered successfully
When the user simulates a network failure immediately after clicking 'Sign In'
Then the network connection is interrupted
When the user observes system behavior and error messages
Then the system displays a network error message and prompts retry
When the network connection is restored within a short time frame
Then the network connection is restored
When the user verifies if the system automatically resumes the sign-in process
Then the system prompts the user to retry sign-in manually
When the user simulates network failure during password validation
Then the system displays a network error message and prompts retry
When the network connection is restored and the user observes system recovery
Then the user is prompted to retry sign-in manually
When the user simulates network failure during session initiation
Then the system displays a network error message and prompts retry
When the network connection is restored and the user attempts to sign in again
Then the user is successfully signed in, and the home page is displayed
When the user verifies system logs for critical point failures
Then relevant error messages are logged for auditing
When the user tests with different network types (Wi-Fi, cellular) during critical points
Then the system handles network failures consistently across different types
When the user ensures no data loss or corruption occurs during critical point failures
Then no data loss; user data remains intact after recovery
When the user tests system behavior with rapid network on/off toggling
Then the system maintains integrity and prompts the user appropriately
