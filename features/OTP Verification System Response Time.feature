Feature: OTP Verification System Response Time
Scenario: Check system response time for OTP verification process
Given the user has initiated an OTP verification process
And the system is operational without any known performance issues
When the user navigates to the OTP verification screen
Then the OTP verification screen is displayed
Scenario: Enter correct OTP and verify response
Given the user is on the OTP verification screen
When the user enters the correct OTP "654321" in the OTP field
Then the system accepts the input and allows submission
Scenario: Verify OTP submission process
Given the correct OTP is entered
When the user clicks on the 'Verify' button
Then the system processes the OTP
And the response time from OTP submission to verification completion is recorded
Scenario: Validate response time limits
Given the response time is recorded
When the response time is measured
Then the response time should be within the acceptable limit of 2 seconds
Scenario: Ensure consistency in OTP verification
Given the OTP verification process is completed
When the process is repeated multiple times
Then the response time remains consistent across multiple attempts
Scenario: Test under different network conditions
Given the system is operational
When the OTP verification process is tested under different network conditions like 3G, 4G, and WiFi
Then the response time is within acceptable limits under these conditions
Scenario: Validate during peak usage hours
Given the system is operational
When the OTP verification process is tested during peak usage hours
Then the response time remains within acceptable limits
Scenario: Check progress indication
Given the OTP verification process is ongoing
When the system processes the OTP
Then the system may display a loading indicator or progress bar
Scenario: Verify response time logging
Given the OTP verification process is completed
When the response time is recorded
Then the response time is logged for performance analysis
Scenario: Handle concurrent OTP requests
Given multiple OTP requests are made concurrently
When the system processes these requests
Then the system handles them efficiently without significant delay
Scenario: Check system optimizations
Given the OTP verification process is completed
When the system processes the OTP
Then the system may implement optimizations to improve response time
Scenario: Provide user feedback on delays
Given the OTP verification takes longer than expected
When the system processes the OTP
Then the user receives feedback or notification if verification is delayed
Scenario: Maintain response time across devices
Given the OTP verification process is tested on different devices and platforms
When the system processes the OTP
Then the response time is consistent across various devices and platforms
Scenario: Meet SLA response time requirements
Given the service level agreement specifies response time requirements
When the OTP verification process is completed
Then the system complies with the response time requirements outlined in the SLA
