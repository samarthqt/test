Feature: Error Message Accessibility Compliance
Scenario: Check error message meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
Given the user is familiar with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
And has access to tools for testing accessibility compliance
And has access to the application where the error message is displayed
When the user logs in to the application with invalid credentials
Then the error message is displayed on the login screen
And the user uses an accessibility testing tool to evaluate the error message against WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
Then the tool identifies no violations of WCAG 2.1 AA standards
And the user verifies the color contrast of the error message text against its background
Then the color contrast ratio meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
And the user checks if the error message is accessible via keyboard navigation
Then the error message is focusable and accessible via keyboard
And the user ensures that the error message is announced by screen readers
Then screen readers announce the error message correctly
And the user validates that the error message is not obscured by other elements when zooming in
Then the error message remains visible and unobstructed at higher zoom levels
And the user checks the error message for text resizing functionality
Then text resizing does not cause the error message to lose readability or functionality
And the user tests the error message for compatibility with high contrast modes
Then the error message is visible and legible in high contrast modes
And the user ensures that the error message does not rely solely on color to convey information
Then the error message uses text or icons in addition to color to convey information
And the user verifies that the error message is placed in a logical reading order
Then the error message appears in the correct reading order for assistive technologies
And the user checks if the error message provides sufficient time for users to read and understand it
Then the error message remains visible long enough for users to read and understand
And the user validates that the error message is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes
Then the error message adjusts to different screen sizes without loss of functionality
And the user ensures that the error message does not trigger any seizures or physical reactions
Then the error message is static and does not cause any seizures
And the user tests the error message for language clarity and simplicity
Then the error message is clear and easy to understand
And the user confirms that the error message is consistent with other accessible elements in the application
Then the error message follows the same accessibility standards as other elements
