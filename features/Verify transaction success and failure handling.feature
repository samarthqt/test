Feature: Verify transaction success and failure handling
@TC-18
Scenario: User logs in with valid credentials
Given the user has valid test user credentials
When the user logs into the system
Then the user should be able to login successfully
@TC-18
Scenario: Successful transaction with valid amount

Given a transaction is in progress
When there is a network failure
Then the system should handle the network failure gracefully
@TC-18
Scenario: Rollback of transaction on failure
Given a transaction has failed
When the system processes the failure
Then the transaction should be rolled back without affecting system state
@TC-18
Scenario: Transaction with expired payment method

Then the system should handle multiple transactions without errors
@TC-18
Scenario: System recovery after transaction failure
Given a transaction has failed
When the system recovers
Then the system should allow subsequent transactions
@TC-18
Scenario: System performance during high transaction load
Given a high transaction load is present

Then the system should maintain performance under load
@TC-18
Scenario: Processing transactions within expected timeframes
