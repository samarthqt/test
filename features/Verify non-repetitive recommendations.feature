Feature: Verify non-repetitive recommendations
@TC-46
Scenario: Ensure the recommendation system does not display repetitive recommendations
Given a user account with recommendation system access
When the user logs in with User ID "54321"
Then the user is successfully logged in and directed to the homepage
@TC-46
Scenario: Navigate to the recommendations section
Given the user is on the homepage
When the user navigates to the recommendations section
Then the recommendation section is visible with product suggestions
And the product categories include Electronics and Clothing
@TC-46
Scenario: Observe non-repetitive recommended products
Given the user is in the recommendations section
When the user observes the list of recommended products
Then no product is repeated in the list of recommendations
@TC-46
Scenario: Refresh recommendations to ensure non-repetition
Given the user is in the recommendations section
When the user refreshes the recommendation section multiple times
Then each refresh presents a new set of non-repetitive recommendations
@TC-46
Scenario: Switch category and verify non-repetitive recommendations
Given the user is in the recommendations section
When the user switches to a different category
Then the recommendations are relevant to the new category and non-repetitive
@TC-46
Scenario: Verify persistence of non-repetitive recommendations across sessions
Given the user is logged in
When the user logs out and logs in again
Then the non-repetitive nature of recommendations persists across sessions
@TC-46
Scenario: Check recommendations on a different device
Given the user is logged in on a different device
When the user checks the recommendations
Then the recommendations remain non-repetitive across different devices
@TC-46
Scenario: Provide feedback on a recommendation and check for repetition
Given the user is in the recommendations section
When the user provides feedback on a recommendation
Then the feedback does not cause repetition in subsequent recommendations
@TC-46
Scenario: System response to a limited product pool
Given the system has a very limited product pool
When the user checks the recommendations
Then the system manages to avoid repetition even with a limited product pool
@TC-46
Scenario: Check for system errors or delays
Given the user is in the recommendations section
When the user checks for any system errors or delays
Then no errors or significant delays are observed in generating non-repetitive recommendations
@TC-46
Scenario: Test recommendation system with a new user account
Given a new user account with recommendation system access
When the new user logs in and checks recommendations
Then the recommendations are non-repetitive even for new users
@TC-46
Scenario: System response to extreme user behavior
Given a user exhibits extreme behavior by browsing only one product repeatedly
When the user checks the recommendations
Then the system maintains non-repetitive recommendations despite extreme user behavior
@TC-46
Scenario: Provide feedback on multiple recommendations quickly
Given the user is in the recommendations section
When the user provides feedback on multiple recommendations in quick succession
Then the system handles feedback inputs without causing repetition
