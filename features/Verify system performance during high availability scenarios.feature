Feature: Verify system performance during high availability scenarios
@TC-261
Scenario: Initiate high availability configuration
Given the system is configured for high availability
When I initiate high availability configuration
Then the system should be configured for high availability without errors
@TC-261
Scenario: Simulate 1000 concurrent users accessing the system
Given user load of 1000 concurrent users
And network latency of 50ms
When I simulate 1000 concurrent users accessing the system
Then the system should handle the load without degradation in performance
@TC-261
Scenario: Measure server response time under load
Given server response time threshold of 200ms
When I measure server response time under load
Then server response time should remain within the threshold of 200ms
@TC-261
Scenario: Introduce network latency
Given network latency of 50ms
When I introduce network latency
Then system performance should not be adversely affected by network latency
@TC-261
Scenario: Monitor system uptime during the test
When I monitor system uptime during the test
Then system uptime should remain at 99.99%
@TC-261
Scenario: Check system logs for errors or warnings
When I check system logs for any errors or warnings
Then no critical errors or warnings should be logged during the test
@TC-261
Scenario: Verify failover mechanisms are operational
When I verify failover mechanisms
Then failover mechanisms should activate seamlessly without user impact
@TC-261
Scenario: Test recovery procedures post-simulation
When I test recovery procedures post-simulation
Then the system should recover without data loss or integrity issues
@TC-261
Scenario: Evaluate system monitoring tool accuracy
When I evaluate system monitoring tool accuracy
Then monitoring tools should accurately report system status and metrics
@TC-261
Scenario: Simulate server maintenance and measure downtime
When I simulate server maintenance and measure downtime
Then downtime during maintenance should be minimized and within acceptable limits
@TC-261
Scenario: Check user experience during high availability scenario
When I check user experience during high availability scenario
Then user experience should remain consistent and positive
@TC-261
Scenario: Test system scalability under increased load
When I test system scalability under increased load
Then the system should scale efficiently to accommodate increased load
@TC-261
Scenario: Verify system alerts for performance issues
When I verify system alerts for any performance issues
Then alerts should be triggered correctly for any performance deviations
@TC-261
Scenario: Assess system's ability to handle peak traffic
When I assess system's ability to handle peak traffic
Then the system should handle peak traffic without performance degradation
@TC-261
Scenario: Ensure system redundancy is effective
When I ensure system redundancy is effective
Then redundancy mechanisms should prevent any single point of failure
