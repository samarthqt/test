Feature: Scalability Tests During Peak Load Conditions
@TC-252
Scenario: Initiate the load testing tool and configure it for peak load simulation
Given the load testing tool is available
When I configure the load testing tool for peak load simulation
Then the load testing tool is ready for peak load simulation
@TC-252
Scenario: Start the simulation with peak load traffic
Given the load testing tool is configured for peak load simulation
When I start the simulation with peak load traffic
Then peak load traffic is simulated as per the configuration
And baseline performance metrics are established
@TC-252
Scenario: Monitor the application performance metrics during peak load
Given peak load traffic is being simulated
When I monitor the application performance metrics
Then the application performance metrics are displayed and recorded
@TC-252
Scenario: Verify that the application scales appropriately to handle peak load
Given the application performance metrics are being monitored
When I verify the application's scalability
Then the application scales up to accommodate peak load without performance degradation
@TC-252
Scenario: Check the application response time during peak load conditions
Given the application is handling peak load
When I check the application response time
Then the application response time remains within acceptable limits
@TC-252
Scenario: Document the performance metrics at peak load
