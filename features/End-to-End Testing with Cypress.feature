Feature: End-to-End Testing with Cypress
""
Scenario: Implement and validate end-to-end testing using Cypress
Given Cypress is installed and configured in the project
And I have access to the version control system with necessary permissions
And I have network connectivity to push changes to the remote repository
""
When I navigate to the project directory where Cypress is configured
Then the terminal should be in the correct project directory
""
"    When I open the Cypress configuration file ""cypress.json"""
Then Cypress should be correctly configured with the necessary settings for the project
""
"    When I create a new test file named ""userFlow.spec.js"" in the ""cypress/integration"" directory"
Then a new test file should be created successfully
""
When I write a test case to simulate user login using the provided credentials
Then the test case should simulate and verify user login functionality
""
When I write a test case to retrieve user data post-login
Then the test case should verify user data retrieval functionality
""
"    When I run the Cypress test suite using the command ""npx cypress open"""
Then Cypress Test Runner should open, and the test suite should be ready to be executed
""
"    When I execute the ""userFlow.spec.js"" test file in the Cypress Test Runner"
Then Cypress should execute the test cases, and results should be displayed in the Test Runner
""
When I verify the test results for user login and data retrieval in the Test Runner
Then all test cases for user login and data retrieval should pass successfully
""
When I review the screenshots and videos captured by Cypress for the test run
Then screenshots and videos should provide a visual confirmation of the test execution
""
When I commit the test file to the version control system
Then the test file should be committed successfully
""
When I push the committed test file to the remote repository
Then the test file should be pushed to the remote repository without errors
""
When I verify the remote repository for the presence of the committed test file
Then the remote repository should contain the newly committed test file
""
When I check the version control system logs to ensure the commit is recorded
Then the commit should be recorded in the version control system logs with the correct message and timestamp
""
When I ensure there are no merge conflicts in the remote repository
Then no merge conflicts should be present, and the repository should be in a stable state
""
When I conduct a code review of the committed test file to ensure code quality
Then the code review should be completed, and the test file should adhere to the coding standards and best practices
